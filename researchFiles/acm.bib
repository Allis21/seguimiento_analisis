abstract = {During the UnboxingCT project summer professional development, the Integrated CT Assessment was piloted with 72 elementary teachers. The assessment is based on computational thinking integration literature and asks teachers to identify different computational thinking concepts in content area scenarios. The assessment allowed us to identify which computational thinking concepts teachers were most familiar with prior to the professional development and assess changes in their understanding following the professional development. Our next step will be validation of the assessment with a larger group of teachers.},

abstract = {In this theoretical paper, we compare computational thinking and self-regulated learning. Many studies use self-regulated learning to foster the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. Self-regulated learning skills are themselves beneficial for any learning process; here, we argue that the relationship between self-regulated learning and computational thinking is closer than the simple observation that self-regulated learning strategies support the acquisition of computational thinking competencies. We sustain that self-regulated learning and computational thinking competencies share many features (and have some differences), which would support synergistic effects so that not only can self-regulated learning be used to attain computational thinking competencies, but computational thinking activities can also be used to foster features of self-regulated learning competencies.},

abstract = {Computer Programming (CP) is difficult to teach and learn. Many students who enroll in CP courses have difficulty learning to program, as they have deficits in problem-solving skills and are unable to understand abstract programming concepts. Some studies also state that teaching methods are often not the most appropriate as they are not personalized to each student’s needs and do not complement their learning styles. We believe that Computational Thinking (CT) can help alleviate the difficulties in learning to program, especially if it is developed from an early age. However, it is also crucial that teachers use effective methods to help their students develop CT skills. There are several Learning Resources (LR) (digital or paper format) to develop CT skills, however, we argue that Neuroeducation can contribute to improving the effectiveness of these LR in the teaching and learning process. The evidence about the brain’s learning process can be transformed into principles applicable in Education (Neuroeducation). To understand how we could train CT at various levels of education we built an ontology, OntoCnE, that describes the CT and CP domains. OntoCnE is composed of 3 layers that define: how to develop CT; which concepts should be taught at each level of education; and appropriate training materials. This paper aims to present a CT development approach based on this ontology together with Neuroeducation guidelines. The result of our research is the fourth layer for OntoCnE, which defines the Neuroeducation guidelines to characterize the materials. To illustrate our proposal, we will use LR PathIt as a case study. This approach can contribute to innovative and more efficient training of CT.},

abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.},

While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery, and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist, and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) stands as a universal problem-solving approach applicable across diverse disciplines, transcending the domain of computer science. It embodies the mental process of structuring a problem to enable a computational solution feasible for both humans and machines. This methodology involves dissecting problems into smaller parts that are easier to understand and solve. This study delineates a meticulously designed series of CT activities within an introductory computer science course and explores their profound impact on student engagement and problem-solving proficiency. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of hands-on CT practice in augmenting students' ability to decompose problems, recognize patterns, and abstract complexities, and employ algorithms effectively. Notably, this infusion of CT not only cultivates theoretical understanding but also bridges the gap between conceptual knowledge and real-world application through the use of computational tools like Python programming. As CT continues to emerge as a cornerstone skill in diverse domains, this research presents compelling evidence advocating for its integration into introductory courses, laying a robust foundation for students to navigate the evolving technological landscape with enhanced problem-solving capabilities.},

abstract = {The adoption of Computational Thinking (CT) in the educational worldwide curricula is progressively gaining importance from various perspectives. One particular approach, known as unplugged, does not require electronic devices and offers notable benefits as it is replicable and adaptable. Moreover, it serves to dismantle the misconception that computer science is exclusively confined to the digital realm. While both plugged and unplugged methodologies are recognized, further exploration of the unplugged approach is required, especially in Upper Secondary Education, where there is less evidence of its effectiveness. This paper presents a summary of a quasi-experimental study conducted with 11th grade students (approximately 16 years old) in a Spanish public high school. 57 students participated: 28 in the control group and 29 in the experimental group. The conducted research, based on a quantitative and experimental design, aimed to investigate the effectiveness of unplugged activities to improve CT abilities in Upper Secondary Education. The results indicated improved skills in the experimental group, suggesting the potential efficacy of unplugged methods in fostering CT abilities.},

abstract = {In this study we examine the use of CT skills when solving Bebras tasks. Bebras tasks are logical puzzles created to introduce, practice and sometimes assess Computational Thinking (CT) skills. We use the think-aloud method to investigate the problem-solving process of participants with advanced CT skills. The contribution of this study is three-fold. First, the study examines how the use of CT skills manifests itself in the problem-solving process. By examining the thought process of participants, our study provides a detailed operationalization of CT skill definitions that could be used in subsequent studies to investigate the use of the skills. Secondly, the study provides a validation of the classification of a selection of Bebras tasks. Our results show that the skills assigned to these Bebras are indeed the skills most often used by the problem solvers while solving the tasks. Finally, even though the skills are used, the results also show that this does not always translate into answering these puzzles correctly. Based on the results we therefore conclude that, without looking at the problem-solving process, the tasks may not be suitable for the assessment of CT skills.},

abstract = {Within a two-year urban teacher residency program at [University], which focuses on training high school teachers to incorporate computational thinking (CT) into STEM education with an emphasis on equity, this study delves into how these preservice teaching residents (TRs) understood and applied CT in high school STEM settings. Based on our initial thematic content analysis of ten 30-minute artifact-based interviews, teachers' understanding and application of CT could be categorized in two ways: 1) One group of teachers showcased clear, explicit knowledge of CT and actively incorporated it into their instruction; 2) Another group, despite their evident understanding of CT, subtly and implicitly integrated CT into their teaching methods. Our findings suggest that while TRs may differ in whether they explicitly or implicitly integrated CT into their lesson plans, their comments suggest that they have foundational understandings and hold values that suggest they can build upon them. The TRs held definitional understandings of CT and had intentions to design and teach with CT integration, explicitly, or more commonly, implicitly. All of the TRs recognized opportunities in their lesson plans for teaching CT to students, which suggests the potential for more explicit integration in the future. These insights guide our subsequent efforts in teacher training, ensuring educators are equipped to weave CT into STEM lessons. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to build strong preservice teaching practices, as they learn to translate CT knowledge into effective teaching practices while working towards higher levels of CT integration.},

This mapping provides an approach to evaluate the suitability of a EUD environment in supporting people performing their daily work while managing and exploiting EUD tools. EUDability is a construct encompassing different dimensions that need to be assessed through a careful scrutiny by human-computer interaction experts, while CT skills should mirror those dimensions from the point of view of assessing the level of ability of users in managing problems with a computational thinking attitude. Moving from the healthcare domain, we present two cases: a tool for geriatric professionals supporting them in the preparation of cognitive exercises for elderly patients; and a tool for pharmacists, which empowers them to create robot programs related to the preparation of personalized medications. These cases have been exploited to show how to unify the EUDability assessment with the CT skills assessment. In particular, the application of the EUDability evaluation method for each tool, as well as the administration of the Computational Thinking Scale to domain experts are shown. The results of the two assessments are reported and discussed, together with the limitations of the present study. The results show the goodness of fit of the proposed EUD tools in the healthcare domain.},

abstract = {Maker-based learning and Computational Thinking (CT) have increased in popularity in formal educational settings over the past decade. Particularly, the combination of CT and making seem to hold promise for providing opportunities for students to learn and use computing concepts outside of computing courses. This paper presents findings from a two year study of the integration of computational making into 5th and 6th grade science classrooms. Students participated in computational making interventions in which they programmed Arduino microcontrollers to create scientific models of concepts that aimed to help them engage with the science content while learning CT and making skills. In this paper, we explore the differences between the desired computing learning progressions, students' performance on assessments, and perceptions of computer science to answer: To what extent are middle school students able to learn computing through computing integrated science curriculum? We observed that the programming concepts taught were largely dependent on the needs of the science and making project. Our findings suggest that while students had opportunities to learn and use programming concepts, their performance on assessments was between 15% and 78% correct for conceptual and applied questions and their programming self-efficacy and their perceptions of computer science were lower than desired. We discuss the implications of these findings and the factors that impact the integration of CT in core disciplines and the challenges this presents as we aim to use integration approaches to effectively teach computing outside of computing courses and to broaden participation in computing.},

abstract = {The recent emphasis on computational thinking (CT) integration across disciplines in elementary education nationwide is important to ensure that students are well-equipped to meet the demands of the data-driven workforce. However, this requirement poses major challenges to early elementary teachers who are faced with little direction in terms of how best to implement and assess their young student's application of these new practices.This project engaged researchers, professional development (PD) providers, and K-2 teachers to develop and design a hybrid PD experience to support teachers in a process of learning about and identifying the use of CT skills and strategies in their students' work. The hybrid PD approach utilized a combination of instructional coaching, both face-to-face and through an online Community of Practice. Researchers used a mixed-methods design to measure teachers' change over time in their understanding of how to identify emergent computational thinking in their students' work process. Data collection methods included teacher focus groups and interviews, classroom observations, and teacher pre- and post-surveys.Preliminary findings showed an increase in teachers' understanding of CT and confidence in engaging their students in CT-integrated lessons. Teachers reported that the combination of in-person PD and online Community of Practice helped them prepare to bring CT into their classroom and cited placing more of a distinct focus on teaching students the process of CT rather than just using CT vocabulary. Teachers also referenced success in evaluating their students' application of CT skills and concepts by using informal and formative assessment strategies that focus on evidence of student understanding rather than assessing CT vocabulary.},

This panel examines the experiences of practitioners - educators, administrators, and curriculum designers--who have both experienced and supported others in incorporating CT in elementary school settings as a pathway to or component of computer science education. All panelists have worked with teachers not previously trained to teach CS and have encountered the many opportunities and difficulties of bringing CS to in-service teachers. They will reflect on the multiple ways educators grapple with CT: as an entry point to computer science, as a way to enrich core disciplines, and as a way to support equitable practice - for example, several of the panelists have experiences leveraging CT and other domains of CS to support the expression and development of emergent bilingual students. The panel will explore ways in which CT and its associated language and strategies for problem solving may provide a particularly helpful onramp to CS generally, including integration with other disciplines and with language about academic skills more generally.},

abstract = {This article presents research conducted within the School of Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence (EPCIA in its original form in Spanish) project, an initiative developed by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training during the 2020-21 academic year. The study investigated whether it is possible to contribute to the development of students’ computational thinking skills and artificial intelligence (AI) literacy through programming activities using the Scratch language and the Machine Learning for Kids platform. The study involved 133 teachers and more than 2,000 students, from 4th to 8th grade, with representation from 17 of the 19 Spanish regions. Students took a quantitative test on computational thinking and another on AI before and after the intervention, and teachers and students also took a questionnaire at the end of it. The results showed that: i) quantitative tests can be used to reliably measure, in terms of internal consistency, the level of development of computational thinking and AI literacy in the Spanish school population of these ages; ii) it is possible to develop students’ computational thinking skills and raise their level of AI literacy through programming activities; iii) the intervention contributed to demystifying the main prejudices regarding AI; iv) a gender gap was found in relation to previous knowledge and experiences with these topics. Overall, the study concluded that introducing the foundations of AI in primary and secondary education in Spain is appropriate, feasible, and relevant.},

abstract = {Programming integration into K-12 curricula has become increasingly important in the rapidly evolving educational landscape. Recognizing the need to develop computational thinking among young learners, this study investigated the impact of the flipped classroom approach on computational thinking in K-12 programming courses in Macao, focusing on primary school students' experiences with block-based programmable hardware. Employing a mixed methods research design, it combined quantitative and qualitative analyses to examine how flipped classroom activities—centered around student engagement with material through e-books, videos, and interactive classroom tasks—affected students' understanding and application of computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Quantitative data were collected using the Programming Computational Thinking Scale (PCTS), and qualitative insights were gathered through semi-structured interviews. The results indicated significant improvements in students' computational concepts and practices, attributed to the advantages of self-study and a stratified approach to task complexity. However, advancements in computational perspectives were less pronounced, highlighting the need for more opportunities for students to refine their presentation skills. The study concluded that the flipped classroom approach, especially with tools like mBlock and Codey-Rocky, effectively nurtured computational thinking in primary school programming courses. It underscored the importance of innovative teaching methods in enhancing students' ability to apply programming concepts in problem-solving and suggested areas for further improvement in educational practices.},

abstract = {In an age of rapid technological development, primary schools now teach programming to young students, focusing on developing their computational thinking, problem-solving, and ability to use computers to create solutions. However, fostering computational thinking skills in younger students was a challenging task. The serious game CodeCombat has become a potential resource for instructing young students in primary schools on basic programming principles using Python.This study delved into the role of the serious game CodeCombat in advancing computational thinking competencies among primary school students undertaking Python in Macao. Using a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest approach, we examined 49 grade-one students over a two-week Python programming course facilitated by CodeCombat. The Computational Thinking Scale (CTS), encompassing Creativity, Cooperativity, Algorithmic Thinking, Problem Solving, and Critical Thinking, was employed to measure shifts in computational thinking before and after the teaching experiment.Data analysis through paired-sample t-test highlighted notable progress in computational thinking skills, with marked improvements specifically in Creativity, Critical Thinking, Algorithmic Thinking, and Problem Solving. However, Cooperativity did not exhibit the same upward trend, implying that CodeCombat's impact was more pronounced on solitary cognitive capabilities than collaborative skills. Moreover, the correlation between different dimensions indicated that these computational thinking skills were mutually reinforcing, suggesting that enhancing one might contribute to the development of others. The findings endorsed that game-based learning is effective in programming education and recommended integrating CodeCombat to improve computational thinking in learning Python programming in primary school.},

abstract = {Computational thinking has become one of the key literacies necessary for talents in the digital and intelligent era of the 21st century. In the current educational environment, the content of the curriculum that is detached from reality and the fragmented knowledge have brought great difficulties to the cultivation of students' computational thinking ability. Contextual teaching can connect knowledge with reality. Through the e-learning platform combined with real-life scenarios to build a specific real situation, which can drive students to carry out rich thinking activities. Therefore, this study designed a blended contextual teaching model for the development of computational thinking based on contextual learning theory and constructivist learning theory. It was applied to the teaching of high school information technology courses, and the effectiveness of the model was verified by investigating and analyzing whether there were changes in students' academic performance and computational thinking ability under the blended contextual teaching model through the questionnaire survey method and the experimental research method. The results of the study show that the application of the model can effectively improve students' academic performance and computational thinking ability, which provides an effective reference and reference for future educational teaching practice.},

abstract = {Pair programming is a collaborative activity that enhances students’ computational thinking (CT) skills. Analyzing students’ interactions during pair programming provides valuable insights into effective learning. However, interpreting classroom dialogues is a challenging and complex task. Due to the simultaneous interaction between interlocutors and other ambient noise in collaborative learning contexts, previous work heavily relied on manual transcription and coding, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in speech and language processing offer promising opportunities to automate and scale up dialogue analysis. Besides, previous work mainly focused on task-related interactions, with little attention to social interactions. To address these gaps, we conducted a four-week CT course with 26 fifth-grade primary school students. We recorded their discussions, transcribed them with speech processing models, and developed a coding scheme and applied LLMs for annotation. Our AI-driven pipeline effectively analyzed classroom recordings with high accuracy and efficiency. After identifying the dialogue patterns, we investigated the relationships between these patterns and CT performance. Four clusters of dialogue patterns have been identified: Inquiry, Constructive Collaboration, Disengagement, and Disputation. We observed that Inquiry and Constructive Collaboration patterns were positively related to students’ CT skills, while Disengagement and Disputation patterns were associated with lower CT performance. This study contributes to the understanding of how dialogue patterns relate to CT performance and provides implications for both research and educational practice in CT learning.},

It also explores the relationship between performance on computational thinking tasks and motivation. Twenty participants,aged between 7 and 9 years old, undertook the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt) as a pre-test, took part in three dance related workshops then completed the BCTt as post-test and responded to an adapted version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). Student performance on the BCTt improved significantly from pre-test to post-test for both boys and girls and seems generalised across the computational categories measured by BCTt. The study did not show a correlation between performance and motivation in girls but suggests that there may be some correlation between improvement in score and reported enjoyment in boys.},

abstract = {Cultivating students' computational thinking skills is one of the important teaching goals of college computer courses, and constructing a scientific and effective structural framework for computational thinking is the basis for implementing computational thinking training. To this end, based on Sternberg's intelligence education theory, combined with software development and programming knowledge, a structural framework of computational thinking was constructed. Subsequently, a project-based teaching activity based on this framework to cultivate students' computational thinking skills was carried out in the college computer programming course "Software Development Technology". By measuring students' computational thinking skills before and after the activity, it was verified that the project-based teaching model based on the proposed framework had a significant effect on improving students' computational thinking skills. By constructing a structural framework of computational thinking that integrates the characteristics of disciplines, and taking programming teaching as a carrier to implement the cultivation of computational thinking skills, it can provide a new way for computer educators to cultivate students' computational thinking skills.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) and problem-solving skills are increasingly integrated into K-8 school curricula worldwide. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop reliable assessments for measuring students' proficiency in these skills. Recent works have proposed tests for assessing these skills across various CT concepts and practices, in particular, based on multi-choice items enabling psychometric validation and usage in large-scale studies. Despite their practical relevance, these tests are limited in how they measure students' computational creativity, a crucial ability when applying CT and problem solving in real-world settings. In our work, we have developed ACE, a novel test focusing on the three higher cognitive levels in Bloom's Taxonomy, i.e., Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. ACE comprises a diverse set of 7x3 multi-choice items spanning these three levels, grounded in elementary block-based visual programming. We evaluate the psychometric properties of ACE through a study conducted with 371 students in grades 3-7 from 10 schools. Based on several psychometric analysis frameworks, our results confirm the reliability and validity of ACE. Our study also shows a positive correlation between students' performance on ACE and performance on Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by Code.org.},

The RPP is motivated in part by the hypothesis that a larger, more diverse group of students will choose to enroll in computer science courses in high school if they gain familiarity and confidence related to computational concepts at earlier grades. Feedback from participating teachers along with student attitude and problem-solving data suggest this is a promising approach.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) technology has been widely used in many industries. Therefore, the cultivation of virtual reality technology talents is imminent. However, there are relatively few universities that carry out virtual reality courses. At the same time, the virtual reality course is a good carrier to cultivate computational thinking. It can improve students ' problem-solving ability, creativity and teamwork ability, which are also necessary to cultivate computational thinking. Computational thinking, as a necessary basic skill for talents in the 21 st century, needs to be improved in the training approach of college teaching. However, there are relatively few teaching approachs to cultivate computational thinking through virtual reality (VR) courses. Based on this, this study constructs a design-based STEM+VR teaching approach, which combines the interdisciplinary knowledge of STEM education with VR subject knowledge, aiming to cultivate college students ' computational thinking through virtual reality courses. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to investigate the complex ability of computational thinking of a college student in Wuhan, including five sub-dimensions:creativity,algorithmic hinking, collaborative ability, critical thinking and dimensional problem solving.The research shows that after the design-based STEM + VR teaching, the abilities in the sub-dimension of computational thinking are significantly improved. The design-based STEM + VR teaching case provided in this study is expected to provide some reference for the use of virtual reality courses to cultivate computational thinking in college education.},

abstract = {With the development of the digital age, online teaching and learning is becoming more widespread in schools around the world. In the online teaching environment, the teaching mode of the course is an important element that receives attention in education and teaching. The online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking can improve students' learning interest and cultivate their innovative thinking ability. However, the author found through educational internship that there are problems such as single teaching activities, lack of teacher-student interaction, poor cooperative learning, and short independent learning time in high school information technology classrooms, which lead to low computational thinking ability and are not conducive to the development of students' innovative ability. The development of students' computational thinking ability is a requirement put forward by the high school information technology curriculum to secondary school students, and the improvement of computational thinking can help students adapt to the future society and meet the demand of future innovative talents. Therefore, this study takes high school students as the research object, under the guidance of constructivism and cognitivism theories, adopts survey research, experimental research and other research methods to construct and verify the online teaching mode based on the cultivation of computational thinking in high school information technology courses. The results of the study show that the online teaching mode based on the development of computational thinking can effectively improve students' algorithmic, evaluation, decomposition, abstraction and generalization thinking abilities, and thus enhance the online learning effect.},

abstract = {Students who receive special services in mathematics or neurodiverse learners (NDLs) deserve to learn mathematics at a rigorous and equitable level as their peers. Yet, many of these students are not reaching proficiency. Computational thinking (CT) may function as a bridge between students' mathematical learning and their everyday lives. We argue that computational thinking is a pathway for NDLs to follow that will bridge the connections between math instruction and the real-life problems with which NDLs are eager to engage. We identified the critical elements needed to support rural special educators' integration of CT into math instruction by identifying intersections between CT, Math, and the assets of NDLs, as well as barriers to implementation. By leveraging connections from an existing RPP (Research-Practice Partnership), which focuses on CS education and Business intersection in rural Maine schools, we created an opportunity for participatory research for special educators and paraprofessionals often overlooked in these processes. We employed a multi-method, design-based research (DBR) approach. Through observational, survey, and interview data, we found that 1) educators are not currently receiving support for integrating CT in special education classrooms, 2) activities piloted by our educators were well received by students, 3) current standards and Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) requirements for NDLs are a significant barrier to implementation. The need for expanded, regular PD for special educators is evident, as is the potential for CT as a bridge for mathematical understanding for NDLs.},

However, theories of constructive hope suggest that as well as imbuing a love of nature we should also help children understand environmental challenges. Computational thinking is a skillset that might help young children frame and address complex problems. This skillset is currently exclusively developed indoors using technological devices and indoor activities. Our research explored an opportunity to develop young children's computational thinking skills through nature play. An observation and contextual inquiry study was conducted with young children in an Early Childhood Education Centre. We found that computational thinking is evident in children's outdoor nature play and that HCI research could undertake design to further enhance their computational thinking skills outdoors. This can add value to their learning by harnessing their interest, understanding and connection, and by introducing children to environmental problem-solving.},

However, how can this emerging technology benefit the development of skills, such as Computational Thinking (CT) and Design Thinking (DT), through a meaningful process of imagining, designing and tinkering with objects that could be used in real-world problems? Our knowledge is still limited, due to the complexity of designing 3D printable models from scratch with the existing digital tools. This paper discusses a web-based tool that enables learners to create and dynamically manipulate the behavior and properties of 3D printable models with high-level programming. This design aims to foster computational thinking, creativity, and design thinking skills as it focuses on the design process of the model, its behavior and its usage after printing. It also presents the results of a pilot study in which secondary school students engaged in a Design Thinking project for designing and printing sustainable everyday objects using this design. The study revealed new kinds of educational potential of 3D printing including the understanding of complex mathematical and CT ideas that were too complicated before, and the connection of CT practices with real-world problems through the implementation of a Design Thinking project with digital media.},

abstract = {As computational thinking (CT) becomes increasingly acknowledged as an important skill in education, self-directed learning (SDL) emerges as a key strategy for developing this capability. The advent of generative AI (GenAI) conversational agents has disrupted the landscape of SDL. However, many questions still arise about several user experience aspects of these agents. This paper focuses on two of these questions: personalization and long-term support. As such, the first part of this study explores the effectiveness of personalizing GenAI through prompt-tuning using a CT-based prompt for solving programming challenges. The second part focuses on identifying the strengths and weaknesses of a GenAI model in a semester-long programming project. Our findings indicate that while prompt-tuning could hinder ease of use and perceived learning assistance, it might lead to higher learning outcomes. Results from a thematic analysis also indicate that GenAI is useful for programming and debugging, but it presents challenges such as over-reliance and diminishing utility over time.},

We show that these student models perform better than a baseline and have the potential for adaptive support in self-directed interaction with the OELE. We design an IPA with the help of teachers, leveraging the student behaviors extracted from data.

abstract = {Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills?Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test.Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India.Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance.Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.},

abstract = {The lack of clarity about the definition of Computational Thinking (CT) undermines its assessment and the formulation of effective learning strategies for its development. We propose an assessment tool in Spanish, designed by carefully selecting Bebras tasks, to measure four specific CT skills in first-year university students with no prior programming experience. The test was validated with a sample of 980 students from a Latin American university. We found a high, positive correlation between test results and Math test results from the National University Selection System, and a medium, positive correlation between test results and grades from the midterm exam in a Programming course. An acceptable level of internal consistency was found (Cronbach's alpha=0.70). We examined the validity of the test using Classical Test Theory. One question showed poor discrimination potential. Its elimination from the test increased the internal consistency, so we propose to replace it.},

abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has become increasingly essential in the current era of rapid digital advancement. Despite the availability of various tools to assess CT, there is a notable scarcity of tools designed for evaluating CT practices in lower elementary students. To address this gap, this study develops a digital game titled "Magical Adventure" based on the Evidence-Centered Game Design (ECGD) framework, which aimed at assessing the CT practices of young children. The game comprises five scenarios, targeting five CT practices respectively, including pattern recognition, abstraction, problem decomposition, algorithmic thinking, and debugging. Scoring criteria were designed to evaluate students' CT abilities based on the anticipated gameplay process data. This study describes the design and development process of the game. Future steps will include validation of its effectiveness through expert reviews and cognitive interviews, followed by empirical research to optimize and refine the game, enhancing its accuracy in reflecting students' CT practices.},

abstract = {In our modern society, technology has profoundly reshaped various aspects of our lives, influencing the way we work, communicate, and interact. This raises a fundamental question: Is the current K-12 education system adequately preparing students for success in this technology-driven era, where innovation and problem-solving skills are essential? A recent study investigated this inquiry. The goal was to integrate Computational Thinking (CT) into the domains of Creative Writing and Creative Media and measure its impacts. This poster describes the design and refinement of summer camp experiences in which predominantly Hispanic female students participated in hands-on CT-based learning to create their own creative stories and films. Educational outcomes were evident through increased student engagement, enhanced collaboration, and improved problem-solving skills, underscoring the intervention's advantages. Furthermore, the researchers gained transforming insights, recognizing the versatility of CT across domains. Camp participants experienced a shift in perspective, with a greater interest in vocations and domains connected to computing. We share lessons learned from these summer camps in the hopes that they will inform other researchers and practitioners who are interested in designing and deploying similar experiences. In summary, the study outlines a trajectory where students and educators skillfully navigate the complexities of contemporary paradigms},

abstract = {With a focus on problem resolution, Computational Thinking (CT) can assist in developing cognitive abilities. A way to work with CT is using educational digital games (EDG), a ludic tool that stimulates the students’ learning. Still, adjustments are needed so that students with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) can use these games. Based on this scenario, we presented a Bachelor’s final paper that envisioned the creation of an EDG, aiming to contribute to the learning of the target audience, based on the promotion of the development of CT. Called “Pensar e Vestir”, the game uses the four pillars of CT by addressing choosing and wearing clothes. For that, the development counted with a multidisciplinary group – stakeholders and specialists from the areas of Computer Science, Education, Specialized Educational Assistance, and ID – and followed the Simple Interaction Design lifecycle model, with the definition of requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation. As a result, this EDG has two phases and eight situations each: time to sleep, the school in the heat, school in the cold, costume, park, tour, teacher, and market. The game was evaluated by specialists, Computing students, and one neurotypical child, we also intend to make a large evaluation with the target audience. As an outcome, the interaction design process with different stakeholders and specialists provides different insights and improvements to the game. Also, the game is accessible to neurotypical and with ID students.},

abstract = {In the information age, computational thinking has become a basic quality necessary for learners. How to effectively improve the teaching effect and cultivate students' computational thinking ability has become the focus of most scholars. With the extensive development of "Internet+", the traditional face-to-face offline teaching mode has been unable to meet the diversified and personalized learning needs of students, and blended learning has become a brand-new teaching mode, and studies have shown that blended learning can effectively improve the computational thinking ability of learners. Therefore, this study analyzes and discusses the current situation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning, which helps us to deeply understand the current situation of high school students' blended learning, think about how to promote high school students' blended learning, and improve high school students' computational thinking ability, so as to promote the quality of education and teaching. In this study, the literature research method, interview analysis method and questionnaire survey method were used to investigate the current situation of blended teaching activities on the cultivation of computational thinking with 138 freshmen, sophomores and juniors in a high school in western China. The results found that the overall situation of computational thinking level in blended learning of students in a high school in western China was moderate. This was characterized by better levels of cooperative and critical thinking skills, and poorer levels of creativity, algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills. By describing the current situation, it can be seen that there are some problems in the level of computational thinking ability of high school students in blended learning, based on this, this study, based on the specific research data, combined with the results of the interviews, puts forward some suggestions for improving the cultivation of high school students' computational thinking ability in blended learning in a high school in western China in three aspects.},

abstract = {Refactoring presents a complex computational challenge, and its learning is intricate, requiring a solid foundation in computational thinking, programming and object-oriented concepts. Moreover, making students realize the importance and benefits of refactoring is also challenging. To address this complexity, we introduce a refactoring teaching method based on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), incorporating single-loop and double-loop learning principles, focusing on fostering deeper and critical learning. We used ChatGPT, a GAI-based tool, and conducted an eight-week mixed-methods study involving 23 computer science undergraduate students. The study involved applying four distinct projects extracted from GitHub, where participants were tasked with identifying code smells and performing the necessary refactoring to improve code quality. The primary focus was on identifying both the positive and negative aspects of the method, as well as delineating the computational thinking characteristics developed during the process. The results indicate that the use of ChatGPT facilitated the learning of refactoring, contributing to the development of numerous computational thinking skills, especially problem formulation, decomposition, and abstraction. Thus, this paper contributes a GAI-based teaching method along with evidence on how it helps students develop refactoring skills.},

To address this gap, 3CPEs combine the hands-on appeal of computer-science unplugged activities with the versatility of programming environments, using familiar objects and gamified elements to visualize abstract computational and algorithmic ideas. An example is CT (Computational Thinking) Chef, a 3CPEs implementation to enhance elementary students’ understanding of programming concepts. Through design workshops with five elementary programming teachers, we preliminarily identified teaching challenges and evaluated 3CPEs’ efficacy as an educational tool. The feedback underscores CT Chef’s potential in facilitating the teaching of intricate computational concepts for young learners.},

abstract = {In recent years, several research projects have introduced elementary school teachers to computational thinking as a first step in familiarizing students with computer science concepts at an early age. A consistent challenge reported in these initiatives is teaching abstraction. This position paper offers preliminary recommendations for abstraction pedagogy in elementary education. These suggestions stem from an analysis of unplugged abstraction examples showcased during a summer institute on computational thinking.By examining commonalities among abstraction examples, key parts of the process of abstraction pertinent to elementary classrooms were identified: (1) the abstraction process is typically performed in reverse since students in elementary school are given abstractions to start with; (2) evaluation of concrete details to support an abstraction is part of the filtering step of abstraction; (3) in the absence of evaluation criteria, pattern recognition can be applied to a set of concrete examples to extract characteristics of an abstraction; and (4) abstractions can be supported by not only concrete details but other abstractions which students will need to develop an understanding of before fully comprehending the initial concept.Preliminary recommendations for abstraction instruction include having students evaluate examples; engaging students in pattern recognition to extract characteristics of an abstraction; developing student fluency in describing abstractions, their supporting examples, and characteristics; and assessing students by asking not only for examples of abstractions, but for their characteristics as well.},

We examine toys and kits sold commercially, developed through research, and used in early childhood classrooms. Our findings indicate that the mathematical and spatial concepts are overlooked in some designs. Prior research examined toys for their affordances related to computational thinking, the present study contributes to understanding of how these toys and kits have the potential to foster foundational mathematics and spatial skills.

Thus, we introduce in this article the GameBot ZoAm, developed for the Discord instant messaging and social platform. ZoAm offers a unique learning experience centered around storytelling, focusing on fundamental computing concepts and logical challenges that enhance computational thinking skills. Furthermore, the game also promotes an appreciation for Amazonian culture and folklore, with decision-making with human values. An action research study was conducted involving students from the last years of the end of elementary school. The research utilized a heuristic analysis based on the Gameplay Heuristics (PLAY) by Desurvire and Wiberg (ANO) and the evaluation model proposed by Korhonen and Koivisto (ANO) for mobile devices. The analysis employed a reduced and merged set of heuristics from these models, suited for the GameBot's context, focusing on (I) usability, (II) gameplay and immersion, and (III) mobility. Regarding the reliability coefficient used to evaluate the survey applied to students after playing the GameBot, Cronbach's Alpha and Guttman Lambda-6 (G6(smc)) coefficients were applied. These metrics were chosen to ensure the internal consistency and reliability of survey items, reflecting on how effectively the questions measured the focuses proposed by the heuristic analysis. The findings indicate that the game has the potential to facilitate the assimilation of the integrated concepts and sustain student interest throughout gameplay.},

However, while the idea of game programming may be compelling from an educational point of view, creating games with interesting interactions that are actually fun to play remains challenging. Modern tools aimed at novice programmers should empower their users to create games, such as Pac-Man, that approach or even exceed the gameplay of 1980's arcade games. By adding a high-level AI pathfinding block to the RULER.game tool, 13 students in grades 1-4 attempted to build Pac-Man-like games. The findings suggest that all students were able to create Pac-Man-like games with compelling gameplay interactions, including ghosts finding the shortest path through complex mazes to Pac-Man, multiple ghosts collaborating with each other, and sophisticated game world topologies featuring toroidal portals.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is considered a necessary skill for the 21st century. Researchers have increasingly focused on how to effectively enhance students’ CT in programming courses. This study proposes a progressive scaffolding approach with flowcharts and visual programming codes applied to a visual programming course based on an open-source hardware platform to improve CT skills and self-efficacy in middle school students. Forty-five middle school students in grades 7 and 8 participated in this study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected by using CT tests, scales, and semi-structured interviews. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) examined differences in CT skills and self-efficacy on the pre-test, mid-test, and post-test. The results indicated that the progressive scaffolding approach significantly improved middle school students’ CT skills and self-efficacy. These results reveal the effectiveness of the progressive scaffolding approach in improving the computational thinking of middle school students in a visual programming course with an open-source hardware platform, which helps to extend the design of progressive scaffolding.},

abstract = {As efforts to incorporate Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) into K-12 classrooms continue to expand, there is a growing need for programs that prepare teachers for the effective teaching and integration of CS and CT into their instruction. An ongoing challenge is preparing current and future teachers to develop the skills and confidence needed to teach and integrate CS and CT. Micro-credentials, designed as a short, focused course, offer opportunities for teachers to build skills and confidence through targeted study. This experience report examines a self-paced online micro-credential developed and implemented within a university-based college of education. The micro-credential was designed to equip both pre-service and in-service teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to teach and integrate CS and CT into K-12 teaching and learning. We describe the micro-credential, including its structure, sequencing, and content. We then present an exploration of teachers' experiences in the micro-credential. Findings from surveys and CS autobiographies show increases in participants' attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions toward the conceptual and technical aspects of teaching CS, with a particular focus on designing clear and actionable plans for integration. The results from this study provide valuable insights for the development of future CS- and CT-focused micro-credentials.},

abstract = {As Computational Thinking (CT) continues to permeate younger age groups in K-12 education, established CT platforms such as Scratch face challenges in catering to these younger learners, particularly those in the elementary school (ages 6-12). Through formative investigation with Scratch experts, we uncover three key obstacles to children’s autonomous Scratch learning: artist’s block in project planning, bounded creativity in asset creation, and inadequate coding guidance during implementation. To address these barriers, we introduce ChatScratch, an AI-augmented system to facilitate autonomous programming learning for young children. ChatScratch employs structured interactive storyboards and visual cues to overcome artist’s block, integrates digital drawing and advanced image generation technologies to elevate creativity, and leverages Scratch-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for professional coding guidance. Our study shows that, compared to Scratch, ChatScratch efficiently fosters autonomous programming learning, and contributes to the creation of high-quality, personally meaningful Scratch projects for children.},

abstract = {Coding for computer programming is a common way to support and assess computational thinking (CT) skills, a set of problem-solving skills essential for computer science (CS) and STEM more broadly. We designed a coding platform, Fox and Field, to determine what kinds of scaffolds can encourage novice coders to behave more like experts. We compared actions between 221 upper-division undergraduate CS/engineering (expert, n=106) and social science (novice, n=115) majors randomized to scaffolding conditions from four universities in the United States. Overall, experts used statistically significantly more practices aligned with CT skills, such as those that increased code efficiency (e.g., non-right angle turns, loops). This difference disappeared when novices were scaffolded by being told to use fewer codes or by priming with critical features. Both experts and novices were equally likely to be swayed by purposefully distracting features within the platform, such as a drawn path to deflect them from the most efficient solution. Results present initial evidence regarding which features of coding platforms can direct students to exercise CT-linked practices, leading to recommendations regarding platform development to better support learning.},

Op-Artist Bridget Riley used geometrical shapes and patterns to express motion across the canvas. The example of Bridget Riley's art inspired U.S. middle and high school students to express their own artistic motions in unplugged and computer coded learning activities.This interdisciplinary lesson began with introducing Bridget Riley's artwork and how she arranged different triangles to create the illusion of movement [1]. Students then recreated one of her works by drawing triangles on graph paper with pencils, mimicking Riley's black-and-white compositions. After this unplugged activity, students transferred this understanding of drawing different triangles to the computer using JavaScript. Students used the gridlines behind their drawn triangles to map the pixel coordinates on a computer screen. Students used commands such as fill to set the color of the triangles and p5js.com's built-in triangle command to draw the triangles by specifying the (x, y) coordinates of each of the three vertices on the computer screen. Students then customized and expanded their code to express their interests (e.g., by picking different colors or effects) and to make it interactive for the user (e.g., by having the triangles' top vertices move left and right with the cursor of the screen). By the end of the lesson, each student created different works of Bridget Riley inspired art through their written code.},

Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) researchers have established rich research to advance educational practices and technology development for computational thinking education and introduced a new concept of computational empowerment. However, the absence of effective formative assessment in the research and practices within computational education hinders the facilitation of continuous learning and the enhancement of computational empowerment. Considering this, this doctoral study will explore the core research question of how to develop formative assessment strategies for computational empowerment through the lens of dialogic learning. The research aims to conceptualize a research-based formative assessment model for educators, formative assessment design principles for computational education toolkits and provide instances through illustrative case studies. The study includes literature reviews, learning intervention case studies and participatory design workshops, stimulating discussions and innovative formative assessment strategies for computational empowerment within the CCI community and among practitioners. This doctoral study addresses the need for effective formative assessment in computational education to understand learning, foster learning and enhance computational empowerment in wider implementation. The practical research outcomes will benefit toolkit designers and educators, while the theoretical contributions aim to fill gaps of formative assessment in CCI research and pedagogies, advancing the broader landscape of computational education.},

abstract = {This SIGCSE poster presents a landscape study of six school districts across six different states in terms of their individual teachers' and administrators' capacity to integrate and implement computational thinking (CT) into their own schools and classrooms. This landscape evaluation represents the baseline start of a wider, four-year national study around district capacity to collaboratively develop consistent and comprehensive K-12 computing pathways for their students and schools. The early landscape work we present here not only represents a starting point for comparing district educators' comprehension of CT (and computer science [CS]), but also acts as an early indicator as to what extent K-12 computing is a school and district-based priority, and to what degree teachers feel they have the capacity to meaningfully implement it. This poster relies on two data sources in a mixed-methods design: Districtwide surveys of teachers and administrators on their familiarity and prioritization of CT, coupled with subsequent hour-long focus group discussions with educators to expand upon their respective district landscape survey responses. Results point to all districts perceiving the broad applicability of CT as a skill set and its integrative potential in a range of subjects. Yet in terms of classroom implementation, teachers find such CT integration decidedly less clear, recognizing it to be a priority but also reporting as less confident about creating their own curricular materials, where CT situates with their district's ongoing initiatives, and where they can find curricular resources and tools specific to their own areas of curricular integration.},

abstract = {How to measure students' Computational Problem-Solving (CPS) competencies is an ongoing research topic. Prevalent approaches vary by measurement tools (e.g., interactive programming, multiple-choice tests, or programming-independent tests) and task types (e.g., debugging problems or Parson problems). However, few studies have examined the measurement tools of CPS competencies themselves: affordances and limitations of the measurement tools and how they compare, or whether different task types might elicit CPS competencies differently. Research needs to address these questions in order to better understand how to design robust, generalizable, and effective measurement tools for CPS competencies. This paper presents an exploratory study that contributes to this research direction. It is part of a larger international project to develop an open-access formative assessment platform for CPS, which includes a novel authoring tool for a wide range of task types for interactive block-based programming. We used the tool to create an interactive programming experience with multiple task types and gave it to more than 300 secondary school students from different countries. We also administered a validated multiple-choice measurement of Computational Thinking with block-based programs. We focused on task complexity as a characteristic of task type, using a classification scheme based on task design features. Comparing students' performances on tasks of different complexity and using two distinct measurement tools, we found that the multiple-choice measurement only partially predicts performance in the interactive programming task. Additionally, its predictive capacity varies significantly between task types of differing complexity.},

abstract = {The rapid rise of computational technologies has heightened the demand for proficient computer scientists. A strong foundation in Computer Science (CS) and Digital Education (German: Digitale Grundbildung DGB) has become crucial, even for young learners. Despite the growing importance of CS and DGB in Austria, a gap remains in comprehensive understanding among students and educators. This study aims to bridge this gap by making CS accessible to primary school students and teachers. The solution, COOL Lab, is an active learning center offering diverse STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) programs. These programs facilitate cross-disciplinary education, supported by innovative CS technologies, nurturing computational thinking (CT) as a problem-solving tool, and enhancing digital skills. Focusing on COOL Lab Clubs, tailored for gifted primary school students, specifically the 'Girls* Only IT-Club' and 'Mini Club', this research first introduces these clubs and then presents insights from four club activities, along with methodologies enhancing CS and CT comprehension. Early results from a questionnaire involving 20 participants aged 9-10 were analyzed. At the outset, almost half of the participants, particularly girls, lacked exposure to CT and CS yet showed eagerness to learn. Initial findings of the club evaluations indicate a strong interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) as well as CS and a positive response to the COOL Clubs.},

To bridge this gap, we developed Robotito VPL – an innovative, free, open-source application tailored to teachers with no programming background. Robotito VPL enables teachers to guide young children in CT learning with Robotito, a robot that engages with its surroundings, supporting a playful, hands-on learning experience for children.

While GenAI certainly poses threats to time-honored instructional techniques, it also provides opportunities for new forms of instructional support. In this work, we introduce our strategy for configuring an LLM to serve as a ''rubber duck debugging'' coding assistant to help novice programmers when they encounter difficulties in programming assignments. The key contribution of this work is not in the idea of using LLMs for debugging itself (which has already been demonstrated elsewhere, e.g., [3]) but to demonstrate the ease, flexibility, and pedagogical potential of the strategy. In particular, through carefully crafted prompts and easily accessible platforms, rubber duck LLMs can assist learners with specific questions while also situating those questions alongside larger computer science concepts and computational thinking practices. This work contributes an easily replicated and model-agnostic instructional strategy that productively and responsibly leverages the power of LLMs to assist novice programmers in developing foundational programming skills.},

abstract = {Objectives. Computer Science (CS) education has become increasingly prevalent in elementary schools because of multiple rationales, such as the importance of computational literacy and the growing demand for CS-related workforce preparation. As elementary CS standards continue to be adopted by many states, more examples and voices from the field may help educators understand what effective computational thinking (CT)/CS integration looks like in practice. Method. We employed a descriptive qualitative approach to study eight award-winning K-8 CS teachers and aimed to answer three research questions: (1) What were elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration? (2) How do elementary CS teachers integrate CT/CS into their classroom practices? (3) What are the needs of CS teachers for meaningful CT/CS integration in elementary schools? Data were collected through interviews, a questionnaire, and artifacts and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings. Our findings of elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration encompassed its essential nature as a literacy skill, its potential to promote equity in education, and its alignment with standards across various disciplines. To support CT/CS integration at the elementary level, CS teachers described important aspects with examples from their instructional practices: (a) Real-world applications; (b) hands-on activities; (c) strategies to scaffold and guide student learning; (d) collaboration with classroom teachers; and (e) support from professional development (PD). Conclusion. The study results shared CS teachers’ voices from practice and shed light on the urgent need for more support and PD opportunities for both homeroom teachers and CS teachers in elementary schools, as well as the crucial need for multiple levels of support within K-12 school systems. Continuous efforts in creating systematic and sustainable PD plans and supporting collaborative professional communities for teachers within the instructional context are a must to help prepare our elementary students with the essential CS knowledge and skills they need to thrive in this technology-rich society.},

abstract = {Like digital technologies themselves, programming education is embedded in the colonial matrix of power, and access to programming knowledge demands immersion in the epistemologies of the Global North. While there is a growing body of work exploring ways to decolonise programming education, far more needs to be done. Current research focuses on the language of instruction and contextual curricula; outward-facing engagements with decolonisation. However, to move towards digital-decoloniality involves scrutinising how programming knowledge is recontextualised within curricula. Part of the project should be equipping both educators and students with the tools to recontextualise programming itself. To dismantle the colonial logic embedded in programming education, attention must be given to the knowledge formation of the discipline to identify moments of disruption. One such moment is the difficulty students face when recontextualising their mental models of computing, from programming skills to programming concepts. This occurs at the moment of reading, tracing and writing code. Programming requires one to refocus computational thinking and engage with a specific semiotic system, translating the authors’ intention into an executable computational process. Disrupting this moment using the strategies of critical literacies opens computer programming and its resulting code to critical examination, allowing an inward-facing decolonial engagement with the discipline.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a common topic within the computing K-12 curricula worldwide. While much of the focus of research is on the use of Generative AI in and for education, AI as a core subject area is still gaining popularity, with much of this research focusing on content and tools that effectively support the teaching of AI. However, as we grow as a field, there is a need currently unmet to provide foundations (in the form of a block model as there exists for programming) to allow researchers to build strong pedagogies and methodologies from, and even a base to design activities and content. Compounding this, as ethics and its relationship to AI in the K-12 classroom grows stronger, there is a further need to provide scaffolding to educators and researchers not only on traditional AI concepts, but also on how they link with ethical knowledge, skills and dispositions. In this paper, the Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) Block Model is developed and introduced. This is a competence-based model to guide effective teaching and learning of Human Centered Artificial Intelligence, as well as research in the K-12 space. The HCAI Block model’s foundation is developed/adapted from the programming Block model and has been adapted and developed using two lenses. The first was through the data science lens through interaction with Computational Thinking 2.0 and competency-based learning. The second lens was through a human-centred lens. The outcome was a ground-up K-12 model where traditional and technical AI concepts have been developed from the start, integrating ethical considerations and human-centred approaches.},

Integrating digital storytelling, where students create short narratives, and CT offers significant potential for promoting interdisciplinary learning for students; however, it is critical to provide both teachers and students with automated support. A promising approach for enabling support is to leverage advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated considerable potential for assessing both programming and natural language artifacts. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to automatically assess student-created block-based programs developed using a narrative-centered learning environment that engages upper elementary students (ages 9 to 11) in learning CT and physical science through the creation of interactive science narratives. Using the narrative programs created by 28 students, we explore the efficacy of LLMs to assess the programs across two dimensions.},

To solve the problems of data bias and feature mismatch that may occur in learner modeling on heterogeneous data, this paper uses the method of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to accurately portray the features of learners' thinking skills and construct a classification model for top talents. First, by analyzing the thinking skills that have the greatest impact on top talents, the features of critical thinking skills, logical thinking skills and computational thinking skills are extracted separately. Then, a learner classification model for top talents was constructed by MKL method. Finally, the model was validated on the dataset and compared with the results of single-kernel learning. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the classification model for top talents based on MKL is significantly better than that of ordinary single-kernel learning, which indicates that the method of MKL performs better in the learner classification model.},

abstract = {Adversarial Thinking (AT) is essential in cybersecurity, fostering strategic problem-solving by anticipating worst-case scenarios. However, its integration into early computing education, especially in the first two years, remains underexplored. Introductory courses like CS 0 build foundational skills but are challenging to implement in resource-limited community colleges. Strengthening AT in these students can enhance their workforce readiness and support transfers to four-year programs. Servingness describes how Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) go beyond merely enrolling Latinx students to address their specific cultural, academic, and social needs. It involves creating inclusive environments where students feel a strong sense of belonging, supported by culturally relevant practices, leadership opportunities, and community engagement. These environments generate feelings of being accepted, valued, and included within a community or group, also called a sense of belonging. This work presents research focused on the incorporation of AT within the first two years of computer science education at community colleges, in particular to a course CS 0. By examining the integration of AT principles in early coursework, the study identifies key characteristics and a sense of belonging that are instrumental in cultivating AT capabilities among students. The findings aim to offer actionable insights for educators in community colleges, enabling them to more effectively prepare students for the complexities of modern computing careers and to address the broader needs of the cybersecurity field. Through this targeted educational approach, students can develop a more robust understanding of adversarial strategies, enhancing their overall computational thinking and problem-solving skills.},

abstract = {With the growing demand for computational skills in the job market, it's imperative that lower secondary school students grasp basic programming concepts such as repetition, modularity, conditionals, and variables. Yet, many students perceive computer science as daunting and irrelevant. Physical computing offers a promising solution to this motivational gap. It enhances intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and positive attitudes towards technology. Moreover, they engage students who may not identify as typical programmers and foster essential computational thinking skills.This research investigates the efficacy of employing the same educational robot in different contexts, such as music, images, colors, and simple video games, while teaching basic programming concepts. We call this approach "multi-context physical computing'' to emphasize the focus on the different application scenarios. We believe that this could benefit students for two reasons. Firstly, by presenting the same concept across different contexts, learners can better grasp the essence of the concept, disentangling it from extraneous contextual associations. Secondly, catering to individual interests by offering diverse contexts may enhance motivation, consequently fostering improved learning outcomes, as predicted by the expectancy-value theory.In order to assess the benefits of the multi-context approach on learning outcomes and motivation, we will compare it to a more traditional single-context approach centered on robot locomotion in a randomized controlled study.},

abstract = {Robots have entered schools and are currently used to achieve different educational goals, as supporting computational thinking, and improving interaction between peers. In this paper we describe 3 uses of robots at schools from European projects practice: we start from telerobotics, where robots are used to support interaction at distance, if students cannot attend lesson. The second example describes how to build an educational pathway with robots to favor inclusion. Then we describe how to use robotics to introduce young students to Embodied Artificial Intelligence. These examples show that robots can be a flexible and effective tool in education as they exploit embodiment.},

We aim to maintain consistency and linkage in learning objectives, learning assessments, teaching materials, learning activities, and course technology under the principle of consistent construction. Learning objectives are clearer and more measurable; learning assessment is more scientific, diverse, and reliable; Curriculum resources can meet the needs of students at different levels and majors; learning activities can fully mobilize students' subjective initiative; Curriculum technology helps to achieve learning objectives, and can reflect the characteristics of the discipline, with universality and progressiveness. Through the construction and practice of the FD-QM standard, the course team has established the principles of course standardization, clarified the direction of course material construction, drawn a knowledge graph of course knowledge points, accurately grasped the degree of learning objectives, upgraded the "characteristic" teaching resource library, enhanced student interest, and integrated ideological and political education into the curriculum, ultimately achieving a comprehensive improvement in the quality of course teaching.},

abstract = {Context-based assignments have been shown as effective and popular for introductory-level computing courses. We study the use of one such context, pencil puzzles (puzzles typically found in newspapers), in upper-level core computing courses. These puzzles are designed to inspire computational thinking, making them a great choice for introductory-level computing assignments, but their fit for upper-level courses is less clear. We collaborated with several instructors of upper-level courses at four institutions, who delivered a pencil-puzzle-based assignment in their course and allowed us to survey their students about their experience. Overall, the students indicated positive perceptions of the assignments. The most varied answers related to implementation aspects of the assignments. To analyze correlations between students' sentiments and their demographic and experiential background, we used mixed-effects regression modeling to analyze this heterogeneous data set. The survey responses were characterized by two dimensions, one roughly corresponding to students' sentiment about the assignment and the other to their technical assessment of the assignment. For the first dimension, we found that the students' self-reported level of preparedness from earlier courses positively correlated with their enjoyment of and satisfaction with the pencil puzzle assignment. The second dimension was correlated with both the level of preparedness as well as the students' self-reported problem solving type: Clarifier, Implementor, Ideator, and Developer. Somewhat surprisingly, the analysis indicated Ideator as being the most positively correlated with the technical aspects of the assignment. Notably, the analysis did not indicate any correlation with students' race or gender in either dimension.},

However, distinctions between children’s and adult’s creative needs exist, which is important when considering the possibility of GenAI for children’s creative usage. Building upon work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), fostering children’s computational thinking skills, this study explores interactions between children (aged 7-13) and GenAI tools through methods of participatory design. We seek to answer two questions: (1) How do children in co-design workshops perceive GenAI tools and their usage for creative works? and (2) How do children navigate the creative process while using GenAI tools? How might these interactions support their confidence in their ability to create? Our findings contribute a model that describes the potential contexts underpinning child-GenAI creative interactions and explores implications of this model for theories of creativity, design, and use of GenAI as a constructionist tool for creative self-efficacy.},

abstract = {Since the release of LLM-based tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT the media and popular scientific literature, but also journals such as the Communications of the ACM, have been flooded with opinions how these tools will change programming. The opinions range from “machines will program themselves”, to “AI does not help programmers”. Of course, these statements are meant to to stir up a discussion, and should be taken with a grain of salt, but we argue that such unfounded statements are potentially harmful. Instead, we propose to investigate which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. In this paper we report on an experiment in which we explore if Computational Thinking (CT) skills predict the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools. Our results show that the ability to develop software using LLM-based tools can indeed be predicted by the score on a CT assessment. There are many limitations to our experiment, and this paper is also a call to discuss how to approach, preferably experimentally, the question of which skills are required to develop software using LLM-based tools. We propose to rephrase this question to include by what kind of people/programmers, to develop what kind of software using what kind of LLM-based tools.},

The study contrasts the challenges faced by students using the micro:bit with those from our team’s previous similar e-textile studies using the LilyPad Arduino. We pinpoint the BBC micro:bit’s limitations from an inclusive design perspective, underscoring the absence of gender-sensitive considerations in its hardware design. The paper presents a critique how upwards of £75 Million were spent deploying the micro:bit without proper user studies of gender equity and e-textiles. We propose design recommendations for future BBC micro:bit versions, advocating for integrating a gender-sensitive participatory design approach to enhance the usability and engagement of computational and creative making with e-textiles for children of all genders.},

abstract = {Computer Science (CS) education is becoming increasingly important in K-12 schooling, with some U.S. states now requiring educators to integrate CS into various disciplinary courses. The CS for Social Studies project supports the integration of CS into Social Studies (SS) classes in rural middle schools. Twenty-five teachers, working mostly in pairs (one SS teacher and one CS or instructional technology teacher), participated in professional learning workshops and received coaching support to design and implement integrated lessons that address both SS and CS learning standards. The current analysis examines the corpus of year-end, project-based integrated CS-SS lessons (n=8), to illuminate how integrated CS-SS lessons can address learning goals across both disciplines. Data sources included teacher-created lesson materials, classroom observations/video, implementation logs, teacher interviews, and student work. Utilizing a framework created to characterize integrated CS-SS lessons, analysis of lessons (as designed and enacted) focuses on three dimensions: (1) depth of CS concepts, (2) integration of CS-SS, and (3) alignment of instructional tools/resources with integration objectives. All lessons addressed standards-aligned CS concepts such as variables, conditionals, branching, and computational thinking skills (e.g., decomposition), and a variety of SS topics including the Civil War, the Great Migration, and personal finance. However, lessons varied in the extent to which they leveraged students' CS knowledge to explicitly enhance SS learning (or vice versa). This analysis suggests there are multiple approaches to using CS concepts to support disciplinary learning, including creating new learning experiences to explore SS content.},

The research team is partnering with a local public STEM high school to design, evaluate, and publicly share an enrichment course that introduces students to data analytics in the context of public health. Integrating data science education and public health will enable students to engage in meaningful data-driven problem solving while promoting civic engagement. A key challenge in introducing data skills in K-12 is addressing barriers to access. To cope with these barriers, the course design incorporates the use of spreadsheets to engage students in computational thinking. This poster will present preliminary assessment results from the 3-week enrichment course conducted in January 2024.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence has rapidly captured-again-the attention of practitioners and the CS Education community. Several initiatives have been spawning to identify effective ways to introduce learners at college and high-school levels to the basics of AI. In this context, we developed Scratch-NB, an extension to the Scratch programming language to equip K-8 learners with foundational tools for developing a Naive-Bayes classifier, explicitly transparenting its internal components. We opted to use Scratch due to its popularity within the CS4All movement and its predominance in schools, and extend the language with a simple implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier as a gateway for introducing basic notions of supervised learning and AI. In this paper, we report the design rationale of our tool and our experience of using it in an informal workshop with children aged 10-12 with no prior knowledge of computational thinking, coding, or AI. The obtained results show that Scratch-NB showed high levels of acceptance among the participants, raised interest in AI, and effectively provided basic foundations, particularly when comparing Scratch-NB with other state-of-the-art tools targeted to this learner group. We argue that our tool has the potential to illuminate further practical and research endeavors when exploring how to effectively introduce younger populations to the foundational notions of AI in practical contexts.},

However, even a creative and hands-on activity such as programming Ozobot robots with color codes requires elementary school teachers to provide adequate help. We therefore developed hint cards based on criteria for effective feedback and common color code mode issues. Based on our experience of using the hint cards in 17 workshops in elementary schools with 328 children and 21 educators, we identify how the hint cards (1) address feedback challenges, (2) support learning, and (3) can be adapted for broader use. We find that hint cards provide benefits at the teacher, learner and organizational level, but also identify possible disadvantageous circumstances. Although the hint cards support learning regarding affective, cognitive and meta-cognitive aspects, strategies for adaptation are needed. We discuss how the hint cards can be used in other contexts, and give recommendations on how to use the knowledge of common issues and hint cards for supporting elementary school teachers with teaching programming.},

abstract = {Traditionally, computer science (CS) in the United States has been an elective subject at the high school level. In recent years, however, some school systems have created a CS graduation requirement. Designing a required CS course that meets the needs of anticipated future advancements in the field necessitates exploring the research question, What computing content do high school teachers, college instructors, and computing industry professionals prioritize in a required computer science course for high school students? To better understand what these different groups perceive to be the essential content of a foundational high school CS course, we conducted a series of focus groups. These focus groups explored participants' (n = 21) thinking about what content would be most important to prioritize in a required high school CS course. Transcripts of the focus groups were abductively coded and then analyzed to determine what CS content priorities were identified and what disagreements about priorities exist. We found that participants (1) emphasized CS knowledge and skills, with minimal reference to dispositions, (2) prioritized content similar to that found in current CS standards, (3) developed broad, high-level descriptions of content, (4) identified contextually relevant factors, (5) foregrounded AI both a tool and as a subdomain of CS, and (6) emphasized computational thinking. These findings can inform further research on the design and implementation of a required high school CS course designed to meet the needs of the future as well as to support revisions of CS standards for high school students.},

We collected and analyzed interview data for 16 participants on their experiences within the course and attitudes towards various output and coding modalities. Throughout the study, the students’ reflections on their own learning revealed the affordances and drawbacks of each resource in terms of outputs the resources provided, feedback the students received, and how both affected the students’ troubleshooting.

abstract = {Given the importance of the introductory programming course (CS1), the Computer Science Education community has devoted a significant effort to generate empirical evidence and propose tools, techniques, and curricular approaches to support students. For instance, Parsons Problems have emerged as one of the preferred scaffolding strategies to help CS1 students get a grasp on programming before being exposed to open write-code assignments. However, prior literature has not given enough attention to those students who fail CS1 and must retake the course. In this paper, we report the results of an exploratory case study aimed at understanding the effectiveness of Parsons Problems as an active scaffolding strategy delivered to CS1 retakers at the University of Chile. In this version of the course, although students were already introduced to computational thinking, program design, and coding (as they were taking CS1 for a second time), it was the first time they were exposed to Parsons Problems. We conducted a follow-up assessment of the students' perceptions throughout the course, employing a combination of focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and end-course surveys. Our results suggest that Parsons Problems are effective for learners beyond the ''novice programmer'' stage (such as the experience of CS1 retakers), highlighting good practices to support the studied group in terms of engagement, performance, and overall student experience.},

abstract = {To address the challenges of generative AI in CS1 education, especially its misuse by students to bypass coding exercises, which undermines their engagement with foundational learning, CS1 curricula are evolving to emphasize higher-level problem-solving and systems thinking. In response, a novel experiential learning initiative grounded in High-Impact Practices was introduced to a CS1 course over the course of 2 semesters, involving 132 students. This initiative utilized robotics lab assignments to enhance computational thinking across various levels of granularity, from individual functional components to overall system behaviors, bridging conceptual understanding with real-world applications. The approach emphasized project-based learning, extended engagement time, and reflective practices to deepen students' understanding of core computing concepts and scaffold knowledge integration. The curriculum featured both individual and team-based lab assignments to build foundational skills followed by collaborative problem-solving. The initiative's impact was assessed against a control group of 427 students who completed traditional web development lab assignments. Evaluation methods included thematic analyses of student reflections, instructor opinion surveys, and statistical analysis of exam performances across the semester. Results revealed a substantial positive effect on self-efficacy and learning outcomes. Students in the experiential learning group reported increased confidence in applying their computing skills to real-world scenarios, heightened engagement, and greater improvements in technical proficiency. Notably, their exam scores demonstrated a statistically significant improvement compared to the control group. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating practical, interactive elements into computer science education to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the field of computing education with their powerful code-generating capabilities. Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

abstract = {Educators should provide access to all students with inclusive and equitable computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) learning outcomes. Yet access to CS and CT is not always available for students with disabilities. This qualitative cross-case study examined the barriers and strengths three exemplar teachers faced, explored the supports and resources they provided, and presented how these teachers defined successful inclusive CS learning outcomes for their students. The data set included analysis of the semistructured teachers' interviews and teaching materials. The results included seven successful strategies the teachers identified: 1) using physical computing, 2) pair programming, 3)connecting CS and Individual Education Plans (IEP), 4)applying hands-on activities, 5) CT integration, 6) using CS vocabulary, and 7)open-ended pedagogy. Three resources and supports the teacher provided emerged from the data set as follows: 1) accessible instructional materials, 2) projects with multiple entry points, and 3) essential scaffolding supports. Whereas four barriers teachers faced; 1. subject matter, 2) accessible tools, 3) students receiving support, 3) the role of CS in instruction, and 4) the role of time served as additional findings. The results suggested that school-based practitioners, including administrators, can overcome the barriers and promote successful strategies that lead to asset-based CS-inclusion in the classroom.},

abstract = {Culturally responsive computing scholars often use the metaphor and heuristic of intersectionality to address issues of race and gender in research with Black, Brown, and Indigenous children in U.S. K12 computer science (CS) education. This has led to critical analyses that reveal the inequitable conditions that children of color face in CS education. Intersectionality has also supported curricular innovations and interventions that aim to make CS education more equitable by being responsive to children's identities and communities. However, the concept of class has received less attention than race and gender by culturally responsive computing scholars who draw on intersectionality in their CS education research. How might class fit into intersectional research and theory in culturally responsive computing scholarship? The objective of this paper is to answer this question with a proof-of-concept study that tests the feasibility of what we call worker-driven computing education. We introduce findings from our research and collaborations with current, once, and retired autoworkers in Detroit, Michigan to define the computational thinking idea of automation from their perspectives. Through analyzing qualitative data, a worker-driven definition of automation was developed by drawing on autoworker-expertise about the points of production in the auto-industry. Our findings reveal how this definition focuses on introducing automation in the context of lifelong learning about how to communicate and work across divisions of labor to make workplaces safe, healthy, and efficient.},

abstract = {The Idaho Elementary Computer Science (CS) Collaborative (IECC) is a researcher-practitioner partnership dedicated to understanding how to better support the predominately rural districts in Idaho to implement elementary CS education. As part of the IECC's work, we conducted a survey of elementary teachers across the state. This poster will present our initial findings. Two of the research questions we addressed via the survey are: (1) What factors would motivate Idaho elementary teachers to pursue professional development (PD) related to CS? (2) What are elementary teachers' perceptions of the value of connecting CS education to rural community economies and industries? Descriptive analyses of 309 survey responses suggest that about three-quarters of elementary teachers reported that the following factors would be at least somewhat influential in their decisions to pursue CS PD: a K-5 computational thinking requirement, a district-wide CS planning staff, a pathway for elementary teachers to earn a certification in CS teaching, and a way to request CS PD funding. Few (9%) Idaho elementary teachers found that the perception of a disconnect between CS education and rural community interests was a significant barrier to elementary CS education. Even so, over 70% of them were moderately to strongly interested in mechanisms for connecting their CS education efforts to rural community industries through guest speakers and industry partnerships. The poster will discuss the implications of these and other emerging findings from the teacher survey, as well as IECC's related surveys of Idaho district superintendents and elementary school principals.},

Co-designed with 20 elementary school teachers and instructional coaches, the module helps students differentiate between artificial intelligence and human intelligence, focusing on the AI4K12 Big Idea of Perception, and specifically how our senses differ from a robot's sensors. The centerpiece of the curriculum is the "alien planet" task, where students program a robot to explore an unseen planet created by a peer, using its sensors to identify objects like "aliens" (green), "water" (blue), and "unique materials" (red). This activity not only builds critical thinking and problem-solving skills but also introduces foundational AI concepts, such as how machines perceive the world differently than humans. By connecting to other subjects like art (e.g., hue values) and linking to students' real-world experiences, the module offers a truly interdisciplinary and relevant approach to early AI education.},

By considering these objects as boundary objects, designers are led to explore how children appropriate objects for playful learning activities beyond adult objectives. This paper discusses Wobblies (see Figure 1), a novel technology probe, to interrogate how a socially-motivated design with conditional and positional interactive behaviour was understandable to children, and how they appropriated the probe in playful activities. We deployed the probe in a rural Australian preschool in a free-play environment. Initial observational findings show that the children understood the procedure of the interactions and moved from exploring to constructive play activities.},

abstract = {Introducing digital literacy to young children develops foundational skills in problem-solving and supports their cognitive development, including critical thinking. However, physical manipulatives for digital literacy are not always designed for early-year environments or specifically for young children. Physical manipulatives can offer developmentally appropriate tools to introduce foundational digital literacy through dynamic system knowledge before children become developmentally ready for more formalised coding activities. This paper presents an initial study in a preschool environment with children (ages 3 – 5 years) using novel physical manipulatives, Embeddables (Fig. 1), in child-led free and guided play activities in a preschool. From our initial analysis of the types of activities the children engaged in, we identify how, firstly, children used the proximal relations to undertake experimental understanding of the devices, which secondly led to using the proximal relationships in their social play, further supported by the scale and feedback of the toys.},

abstract = {While most teachers welcome the idea of learning activities fostering creativity, it is not clear how to effectively scaffold creativity. Without suitable pedagogical approaches, it is difficult to provide appropriate levels of scaffolding. Over-scaffolding, on the one hand, while providing support appreciated especially by less experienced students, leaves little room for creative expression. Under-scaffolding, on the other hand, while fostering more authentic learning opportunities with a high potential for creativity, can lead to student frustration. The Process Artifact Creativity Landscape (PACL) is a framework that helps pre-service teachers scaffold creative projects. PACL consists of a two dimensional space providing four scaffolding approaches offering different tradeoffs between scaffolding and creativity. This paper introduces the PACL framework and outlines experiences with K–6 preservice teachers reasoning about scaffold creative programming projects.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

abstract = {Programming courses can be challenging for first year university students, especially for those without prior coding experience. Students initially struggle with code syntax, but as more advanced topics are introduced across a semester, the difficulty in learning to program shifts to learning computational thinking (e.g., debugging strategies). This study examined the relationships between students' rate of programming errors and their grades on two exams. Using an online integrated development environment, data were collected from 280 students in a Java programming course. The course had two parts. The first focused on introductory procedural programming and culminated with exam 1, while the second part covered more complex topics and object-oriented programming and ended with exam 2. To measure students' programming abilities, 51095 code snapshots were collected from students while they completed assignments that were autograded based on unit tests. Compiler and runtime errors were extracted from the snapshots, and three measures - Error Count, Error Quotient and Repeated Error Density - were explored to identify the best measure explaining variability in exam grades. Models utilizing Error Quotient outperformed the models using the other two measures, in terms of the explained variability in grades and Bayesian Information Criterion. Compiler errors were significant predictors of exam 1 grades but not exam 2 grades; only runtime errors significantly predicted exam 2 grades. The findings indicate that leveraging Error Quotient with multiple error types (compiler and runtime) may be a better measure of students' introductory programming abilities, though still not explaining most of the observed variability.},

abstract = {Integrated computing uses computing tools and concepts to support learning in other disciplines while giving all students opportunities to experience computer science. Integrated computing is often motivated as a way to introduce computing to students in a low-stakes environment, reducing barriers to learning computer science, often especially for underrepresented groups. This study explored integrated computing activities implemented in US schools to examine which programming and CT concepts they teach and whether those concepts differed across contexts. We gathered data on 262 integrated computing activities from in-service K-12 teachers and 20 contextual factors related to the classroom, the teacher, and the school. Our analysis revealed that programming and CT concepts were inversely related to five contextual factors, such that factors predicting more CT concepts also predicted fewer programming concepts. These factors reflected school resources, such that wealthier schools used activities with more CT concepts and fewer programming concepts. In addition, factors related to underrepresented groups often related to fewer concepts being taught in activities. School racial composition was the only factor of the 20 that had a relationship with both types of concepts in the same direction-students from underrepresented groups used activities with fewer CT and programming concepts. Our findings suggest that, although integrated computing can potentially introduce computing to a broader audience, we must evaluate what these activities are teaching and to whom. Another primary contribution of this work is an open-access dataset about integrated computing activities, the concepts that they teach, and the contextual factors around their use.},

abstract = {A research-practice partnership (RPP) used a teacher co-design process, supported by equity-focused professional development, to create an elementary-level curriculum that integrates content, practices, and learning progressions from state computing standards with other standards-based curricula. Most district students are part of historically marginalized groups and the RPP chose to develop an equity and inclusion-focused curriculum that would be taught in all elementary classrooms to all students. Twelve teacher teams, supported by researchers and ELL and SPED specialists, designed, piloted, and documented 23 modules of 4-8, 45-minute lessons across K-5. Early adopter teachers followed the pilots and implemented the modules in their classrooms with the goal of facilitating adoption by all elementary classroom teachers. After being interrupted by the pandemic, the RPP developed a strategy where principals in cohorts of schools agreed to collaborate with RPP school-based lead teachers to establish professional learning communities (PLCs) to support classroom implementation of the modules. Eleven schools participated in a 2021-22 cohort and nine more schools joined in 2022-23. Centering equity, PLCs, and quality module documentation and materials are key to sustaining and evolving the CSforAll curriculum. The modules were revised based on feedback obtained from ELL and SPED specialists, early adopters, teacher coordinators, researchers, and district curriculum directors. Using a large data set of meeting and classroom observation records, interviews, field notes, focus groups, surveys, and module documentation, we track the evolution of the curriculum and provide a detailed analysis of one module as an example.},

abstract = {Algebraic laws of functions in mathematics – such as commutativity, associativity, and idempotence – are often used as the basis to derive more sophisticated properties of complex mathematical structures and are heavily used in abstract computational thinking. Algebraic laws of functions in coding, however, are rarely considered. Yet, they are essential. For example, commutativity and associativity are crucial to ensure correctness of a variety of software systems in numerous domains, such as compiler optimization, big data processing, data flow processing, machine learning or distributed algorithms and data structures. Still, most programming languages lack built-in mechanisms to enforce and verify that operations adhere to such properties. In this paper, we propose a verifier specialized on a set of fundamental algebraic laws that ensures that such laws hold in application code. The verifier can conjecture auxiliary properties and can reason about both equalities and inequalities of expressions, which is crucial to prove a given property when other competitors do not succeed. We implement these ideas in the Propel verifier. Our evaluation against five state-of-the-art verifiers on a total of 142 instances of algebraic properties shows that Propel is able to automatically deduce algebraic properties in different domains that rely on such properties for correctness, even in cases where competitors fail to verify the same properties or time out.},

abstract = {CS0 and CS1 courses are becoming an essential part of many social science programs, including sociology and political science. This particular assignment was designed as part of the 'Basics of Programming in Python' course for undergraduate political science students. The course aims not only to prepare students for the unified programming exam, but also to apply concepts of computational thinking in the context of political science problems. By linking these fields, students learn to overcome inner barriers in coding and explore the potential of computational social science methods for both academic path and career.  This project seeks such a connection between subjects of political science major as Comparative Electoral Systems and Quantitative Methods of Political Research, and concepts of computer science. Students process the generated votes, applying critical thinking to identify spoilt ballots, and then formulate rules for counting votes (First-past-the-post, Borda count, Condorcet winner criterion) in algorithmic form. Optionally, a short essay can be added in which students are asked to speculate about political leanings, the transitivity of preferences and the advantages/disadvantages of particular electoral systems based on analyses of the data in the assignment. As the result, students not only develop hard skills in programming, but most importantly conceptualize complicated topics through the prism of their specialization, fostering the ability to see the connections between these fields and understand how they can work together to address complex real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {This work presents an experimental analysis of first-grade students' block-based programming trajectories. These trajectories consist of edit-level program snapshots that capture learners' problem-solving processes in a navigational microworld. Our results highlight the potential of this fine-grained data capture. Snapshot frequencies in trajectories collected before and after a coding intervention showcase the collective progress of the learners. Graph visualizations, in which nodes represent snapshots and directed edges code edits, highlight strategies, pitfalls and debugging procedures. Individual programming trajectories shed light on details of learners' problem-solving processes that less granular analysis would conceal. Various works in the field of Learning Analytics research show the usefulness of collecting fine-grained process data that proceed from programming activities. However, how to analyze this data is still an open question and research on the subject is in an experimental phase. We contribute to this experimentation by analyzing and discussing results collected from 30 first-grade students in a pretest-posttest study.},

abstract = {Integrated computing curricula combine learning objectives in computing with those in another discipline, like literacy, math, or science, to give all students experience with computing, typically before they must decide whether to take standalone CS courses. One goal of integrated computing curricula is to provide an accessible path to an introductory computing course by introducing computing concepts and practices in required courses. This study analyzed integrated computing curricula to determine which CS practices and concepts are taught, how extensively the curricula are taught, and, by extension, how they might prepare students for later computing courses. The authors conducted a content analysis to examine primary and lower secondary (i.e., K-8) curricula that are taught in non-CS classrooms, have explicit CS learning objectives (i.e., CS+X), and that took 5+ hours to complete. Lesson plans, descriptions, and resources were scored based on frameworks developed from the K-12 CS Framework, including programming concepts, non-programming CS concepts, and CS practices. The results found that curricula most extensively taught introductory concepts and practices, such as sequences, and rarely taught more advanced content, such as conditionals. Students who engage with most of these curricula would have no experience working with fundamental concepts, like variables, operators, data collection or storage, or abstraction in the context of a program. While this focus might be appropriate for integrated curricula, it has implications for the prior knowledge that students should be expected to have when starting standalone computing courses.},

abstract = {The goal of teaching everyone computing (explicitly including programming) predates the definition of the computer science (CS) major and even the prospect of a software development career. At the University of Michigan, we are creating courses for non-CS majors which are grounded in the computational practices of liberal arts and sciences faculty. These courses have no connection to the CS major curriculum or software development jobs. We focus here on two of the themes that those faculty valued (Computing for Expression and Computing for Justice) and the introductory courses that we designed around each theme. The courses emphasize gaining broad perspectives of computing, which serve the study of multiple disciplines. Student activities include readings, writing essays, classroom discussion, and open-ended programming homework assignments. This experience report describes our design process, the Creative Expression and Social Justice courses, and an initial evaluation of our design. Most of the programming assignments were written in the block-based programming language Snap!, with some in-class exercises using teaspoon languages. Several units ended with an ebook assignment to connect the Snap! programming to equivalent programs in Python, Processing, and SQL. Interview and survey findings suggest that students found this sequence and the courses useful, despite not counting toward a CS major or focusing on early software development skills. Students described usefulness in terms of developing general computing knowledge, preparation for a range of future careers, and introducing them to other course choices.},

One of the main barriers to implementing this into K-12 classrooms is a lack of research on how in-service CS teachers can integrate critical pedagogy into their school context and existing curricula. This lightning talk presents a proposed method to co-design lessons with current K-12 CS teachers to integrate critical perspectives into their classrooms. Teacher participants will join a synchronous summer professional development where we will teach them critical computing content drawn from relevant books and frameworks, and collaborate with them to design or modify lessons that will engage their students in critical analysis. Teachers will be encouraged to include content relevant to their communities. For example, a teacher in Detroit might teach facial recognition in the context of continued use of the technology by police, despite wrongful arrests. Results from this work will inform future sociocultural content integration into K-12 CS courses (e.g. "ethics content"). Feedback from the audience will be used to improve the methods and literature review of the study.},

Yet, educators are those who deal directly with the student and introduce these technology to the student. This paper examines the perception of educators on the use of computational technology in the classroom. We conducted a qualitative study consisting of semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions with K-12 educators. The data from the study was then analysed to extract thematic group perceptions on the use of technology in the classroom. The results show that most educators believe that technology enhances learning in general even though there may be some aspects of learning that are inhibited by technology. Furthermore, the solutions offered by computational technology are instrumental in solving business, health, and societal problems. These industry relies on the problem-solving capacity of learners from the school system who possess computational skills. Hence, the educators recommend that students should be introduced to computational technology as early as possible because the knowledge of computational technology is essential for the students’ future careers.},

You will learn how freely available libraries can be used to exploit parallelism using shared memory parallel programming, using both plugged and unplugged activities that are usable in a classroom setting.No equipment or prior experience is required, but a laptop that can run C++, Java, and Python is recommended for following along with some code examples. The activities and discussion models have been used successfully to teach PDC concepts in early computing courses and will be available after the workshop. Participants will receive a stipend of 400 to defray their cost of registration and one-night hotel stay. The CDER center will also have a booth in the exhibition hall for additional support.},

abstract = {The premise for the development of the Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course was aimed at broadening participation in computing, as a high school level CS course. Since AP courses carry credibility with millions of students who take AP Exams as they are recognized with prospects of obtaining a college education, the hope was that the AP CS Principles course would lead to increased participation in AP CS Exams, especially with students historically excluded in CS including girls, Black, Hispanic, and Native American students, as well those with disabilities. The course raises opportunities and access to CS in higher education. The AP CS Principles curriculum framework is used in the development of the Exam which is significant in the creation college credit and placement policies. Nearly 1,300 colleges and universities have created policies providing students with opportunities to receive college credit or placement for scoring a 3 or higher on the AP CS Principles Exam [12].The AP CS Principles curriculum framework is also used to define the learning outcomes for the course and stands as a pivotal tool in shaping high school CS education pathways to post-secondary introductory CS courses: It was designed to meet rigorous content requirements of an innovative first semester college-level introductory CS course. It exposes students to demanding expectations of building high levels of computational thinking skills and practical applications of programming that are valuable as they advance in their academics. It provides opportunities for students to connect fundamental programming concepts with important topics such as understanding the role of data in programming, and how data is processed and analyzed. AP CS Principles also recognizes the societal impacts of technology and teaches students about ethical considerations that may arise when analyzing bias in technological systems so that students develop a well-rounded perspective on technology's role in society [5]. Additional themes such as the infrastructure of the Internet including networks and protocols are also included.This paper focuses on the vision of the AP CS Principles course underpinnings (a) being engaging and appealing to a wider range of students, (b) making it accessible for a more racially, ethnically, and gender-identity diverse population of high school students, and (c) providing the benefits of the AP label on students' high school transcripts gives them options to consider a pathway into college CS studies with an enhanced admissions appeal, potential academic scholarships, and/or careers in the field. We investigate the structure of the AP CS Principles curriculum framework as a key resource that impacts the kinds of teaching and learning that is promoted in the Course and Exam Description. We discuss our experiences with the imbalanced emphasis on inclusive pedagogy and building community within the classroom to directly increase sense of belonging with students historically excluded from computing. Lastly, while the AP CS Principles Exam continues to flourish in participation numbers, we question the effectiveness of policies to promote broadening participation in computing. We review policies from three different states and discuss how they leverage the AP CS Principles course to promote teacher certification and student enrollment but do not necessarily ensure equitable practices to promote diverse representation in terms of gender, race, socioeconomic background, and disability.},

abstract = {Design thinking (DT) and computational activities foster children’s knowledge capital for 21st-century literacies. The analysis of these activities often overlooks affective and behavioural states despite their significance in providing insights into children’s learning processes. Typically, these states and their changes are self-reported, lacking real-time capturing. Moreover, inquiries via Multi-Modal Data (MMD) for more comprehensive views are underrepresented in the current literature. We, therefore, conducted a DT activity focusing on coding engaging 33 children (aged 10 to 12) and analysed measurements including learning gain (from knowledge tests) and behavioural and affective states (from physiological sensors, video and voice recordings). Our results show that engagement and confusion exhibit positive correlations between MMD measurements and learning gain, while stress, frustration and anger stand out as detrimental for it. By mapping transitions in states experienced by the children, we unravelled negative learning scenarios that should be limited, along with positive indicators of increased performance.},

abstract = {There is greater demand for Computer Science (CS) to be taught in elementary education as more states pass policies requiring it. Integrating CS into elementary education provides a viable avenue to teach CS to all students and can result in more equitable outcomes. However, our research demonstrates many elementary educators have concerns about not having enough time, training, knowledge, curricula, resources, and/or support to teach or integrate CS in their general education classrooms. This session will bring together educators, curriculum developers, professional learning providers, researchers, and practitioners interested in fostering CS and computational thinking skills among young learners. Topics will include how CS is currently being taught or integrated into elementary education, reasons why teachers are or are not integrating CS, resources and supports to address barriers to teaching CS, and what is needed to increase the integration of CS in elementary education on larger scales.  Attendees will have the opportunity to share their experiences, challenges, successes, and learnings related to teaching and/or integrating CS in elementary education toward the goals of learning from diverse perspectives and building collaborations to enhance their work. The discussion will delve into the importance of and barriers to early CS education, identify best practices and inclusive resources to make it accessible and engaging, and facilitate connections to others with similar interests to build a supportive CS learning community. This session will provide a comprehensive exploration of various perspectives in CS education.},

abstract = {Most CS1 classes are designed to teach programming and computational thinking using a specific programming language such as Python or Java. This type of in-depth study leaves little room for creative exploration by students. In particular, at large colleges and universities, the programming assignments are usually autograded to keep up with expanding enrollment. This lightning talk will introduce the idea that simply adding three creative labs that do not use the actual course material, but instead expose students to other computing concepts, can give the students who are struggling a chance to catch up, while also offering them a much-needed breather doing something in computing that is individually directed and creative.Over the last few years, my Teaching Assistants (TAs) and I have developed three simple web development labs as assignments for our large CS1 classes. These three labs are usually given around each of the exam weeks and provide a much-needed break for the students from the regular class material that continues to build upon prior learning. Many students report that the labs were their favorite part of the course because they were creative and self-directed.This lightning talk aims to gather feedback on this concept and assess its potential for integration into advanced CS courses. I'm also keen to hear suggestions for alternative labs in a CS1 class that would both introduce students to further CS principles and allow them to showcase their creativity.},

abstract = {Abstraction is a fundamental yet challenging skill to teach and learn in Computer Science education. Traditional frameworks of abstraction and concept formation often emphasize understanding an abstraction over its application, the latter being critical for practical Computer Science. Additionally, a common issue in education is when students may understand a concept in a classroom or a very specific setting but struggle to apply it outside of that context. In response, we present here a novel pedagogical framework designed to enhance both the development and application of abstraction skills in diverse educational contexts within the field of Computer Science. Our framework synthesizes common themes from existing models while introducing a new dimension focused explicitly on the actionable development of abstraction skills. Educators can adapt the framework to various educational contexts to support development of students' abstraction skills. Our framework was iteratively developed through a combination of theoretical analysis and reflective practice across multiple teaching contexts. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework by applying it to various case studies, demonstrating its broad applicability and practical utility. By offering a flexible yet comprehensive structure, our framework enables educators to effectively organize and deliver educational content, guiding students from abstract theoretical concepts to their practical application in Computer Science.},

abstract = {BBC micro:bits have long been used in informal and pre-college educational environments. With a wealth of sensors and a rich ecosystem of add-ons, it provides an engaging platform for teaching basic computer science. The use of block programming separates the learning of Computational Thinking and coding from the challenges students face with language syntax. In addition, the physicality of the device increases student engagement as they see code interact with the real world.Typical university CS1 courses are already struggling to cover the content required for CS1 and CS2 courses. Adding yet another task to the lecture component is not tenable. However, implementing the micro:bit in the lab component to complement the lecture allows the student to enjoy the engagement provided by the micro:bit in the lab to motivate learning in the lecture. This is particularly important as overall student engagement has declined post-COVID. Creation of a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game on the micro:bit introduces the concepts of variables and conditional statements using a block language, and allows automatic conversion to Python. Based on our experience with the use of the micro:bit in informal education settings, we know that student engagement with the device is high.Students will shift to using the MakeCode Python block components and add functionality manually as they become more familiar with Python syntax. The workshop will provide lesson plans and assignments for a full sequence of labs to use in CS1 and how they relate to the lecture sequence.},

Individuals could design and build their own personalised digital interventions to help them reach their goals, but little is known about this process. Building upon previous research we propose the Behaviour Change with Trigger-Action Programming (BC-TAP) model which describes how individuals could bridge the gap between their current and desired behaviour through the creation of 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) digital interventions. We conducted a two-day participatory workshop based on the BC-TAP model with 28 participants. Participants articulated plans to change a behaviour of their choice and represented these plans in mobile device automations. After using their interventions for up to three weeks, participants reflected on their experience. Our findings report opportunities and challenges at each stage of the process. While formulating a digital proxy for certain behaviours was challenging, both failures and successes facilitated participants' awareness of their behaviour, and their ability to change it.},

As new technologies rapidly expanded the field, the computer science curricula emerged. The current undergraduate areas of study, including computer science and software engineering, focus on preparing students for careers in the computing industry or academia. The “born digital” students of a modern liberal arts institution need a different, less technology-heavy, form of computing education to support their careers as future scientists, artists, or humanists. At our large, research-focused, US university, the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) charged a task force with defining the computing education needs for their students, chaired by the authors. We describe our process, findings and outcomes here with the aim of offering a reference template to faculty at universities that have experienced a similar growth to prominence of computer science in the undergraduate curriculum. The task force identified emergent themes of discovery, expression, and justice that we using to establish a new program, the Program for Computing in the Arts and Sciences (PCAS). Our themes and process may help other liberal arts and sciences programs organize the computing education needs in support of all their undergraduate students.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, schools around the world have introduced coding in elementary education. A principal challenge with this effort is effectively training and maintaining teachers capable of teaching coding to children. An approach used by BootUp Professional Development is to team up with school districts that provide an Instructional Coach (IC). ICs are district-level personnel that support in-service teachers by co-planning, training, modeling, providing resources, and generally supporting teachers to implement coding in their classrooms. ICs remain in the district long after the professional development provider completes their training, potentially addressing training challenges introduced by teacher attrition. Some of the benefits provided by ICs are: (a) longevity, (b) expertise, and (c) near-peer support. However, the roles and responsibilities of ICs vary by district. In this study, we surveyed 49 ICs to better understand their role in supporting elementary teachers to integrate coding into general education. Findings show that while ICs are experienced teachers, they are relatively novice coders. ICs rely on principals and district personnel to set teachers' coding expectations, which can either help or hinder their ability to support teachers. In this poster, we will discuss additional successes, challenges, and support structures that ICs face as they seek to support the effective teaching of coding in elementary education.},

In recent years, the recognition of games as facilitators of experiential learning has grown, highlighting their innate suitability for reflective learning. The Reflective Game Design (RGD) framework is a new tool for incorporating reflective learning into game-based leading approaches, amplifying the reflective and experiential learning process. This study discusses the practical application of the RGD framework, guided by the principles of “Design Thinking”, to create a user-centric development process. This paper presents a case study on developing a serious digital game targeting “self-awareness among young adults”. By applying the RGD framework guided by design thinking, the study adopts an iterative design process, user empathy, and reflective practices to offer insights into integrating these frameworks effectively. The positive findings from user surveys indicate a strong connection between players and the game, suggesting its potential for future educational use. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on interactive and educational game design, providing valuable perspectives for researchers, developers, and educators.},

Given the widespread use of this tool and the lack of knowledge over how it can support learning, there is a need for educators to have a framework for using it in the classroom and teaching their students usage strategies that are beneficial for learning. One pathway forward is through creativity, a process crucial for learning and also connected to the act of using gen-AI. This poster demonstrates the results of a study designed to provide an in-depth view on how creativity intersects with gen-AI usage in a computational physics course. In the course, students learn about computing tools during group-based, open-ended computational physics activities. Students are often tasked with using gen-AI to explore and help make decisions. The findings demonstrate a connection between using gen-AI and engaging in creative processes, and the implications point to strategies for supporting student usage of gen-AI.},

abstract = {Ethnocomputing describes the study of computational ideas and thinking as they appear in the artifacts, epistemologies, designs, and practices of temporally and spatially situated communities (e.g., from computational scientists to textile artisans). It is also about how such communities embed their beliefs and values within computational artifacts. One outcome of ethnocomputing research is the demonstration of how Indigenous and diasporic communities have dynamic computational histories and innovations that are relevant to computer science and computer science education today. From lessons on e-textiles and Native American botanical knowledge to visual programming environments that reveal the algorithms of cornrow braiding in the Black diaspora, this has allowed for anti-racist challenges to white supremacist myths of primitivism in primary and secondary computer science education. While there are studies about how ethnocomputing tools and lessons shape children's attitudes toward and knowledge of computing, there is no research on what computer science teachers think about one of ethnocomputing's foundational assumptions: computational ideas and thinking are embedded within Indigenous and vernacular artifacts, epistemologies, designs, and practices. This paper reports findings from interviews with 14 K12 computer science teachers who had been exposed to ethnocomputing educational technologies and activities. From our qualitative analyses, we found that most (n=12) teachers believed that Indigenous and/or vernacular artisans think computationally. We detail their lines of reasoning before turning toward teachers who had ambivalent (n=1) or negative (n=1) positions about this assumption of ethnocomputing research. We discuss the implications of these findings for anti-racist K12 computer science teacher professional development.},

Design partnering denotes a process in which neurodiverse children are teamed up with neurotypical peers to help them overcome cognitive, social, and relational barriers and thus make their engagement more active during design. We contribute with studies of design partnering in three different PD activities: Field studies, Ideation, and Prototyping. We map out the opportunities and challenges we faced in our study when applying design partnering in PD research. We discuss our findings to lay out future studies to be conducted in Child-Computer Interaction research to provide more knowledge on the potentiality and challenges of design partnering in PD.},

abstract = {Computing education is becoming increasingly important in high school curricula, but there are challenges in teaching computing, including teachers' professional development and the development of appropriate learning tools. Participatory design and cooperative prototyping offer opportunities for identifying challenges in computing education and ways for teachers to be involved in the design of new learning tools. This study describes the process of codesigning a learning tool to overcome some of these challenges for computing education in high school, involving teachers, developers, and researchers as collaborators. The study investigating how cooperative prototyping and participatory design can lead to mutual learning about challenges in teaching computing. We prototyped learning activities and the learning tool, CoTinker, in collaboration between six teachers, two developers, and four researchers in four subcases and implemented them in classrooms with a total of 83 students. We show how challenges such as students' collaboration and transfer of knowledge in computing education were overcome by applying the prototypes in computing education classrooms in high school.},

abstract = {Data science is emerging as a crucial 21st-century competence, influencing professional practices from citing evidence when advocating for social change to developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. For middle and high school students, data science can put formerly decontextualized subjects into real-world scenarios. Many existing curricula, however, lack authenticity and personal relevance for students. A critique of data science courseware cites the lack of "author proximity," in which students do not contribute to the data's production or see their personal experiences reflected in the data. This paper introduces a novel data science curriculum to scaffold middle and high school students in undertaking real-world data science practices. Through project-based learning modules, the curriculum engages students in investigating solutions to community-based problems through visualization and analysis of live sensor data and public data sets. Materials include formative assessments to help educators (especially those from non-math and computing backgrounds) measure their students' abilities to identify statistical patterns, critically evaluate data biases, and make predictions. As we pilot and co-design with teachers, we will look closely at whether the curriculum's resources can successfully support non-technical practitioners engaging in an integrated curriculum.},

In addition to divergent and convergent thinking, ethnographic interviewing enables a full landscape of a user’s holistic needs to be considered, ultimately allowing those who use the technology to openly explore their unmet needs, future scenarios, and ideal states; enabling it to answer complex questions and technological needs in a human-centric process. In this paper, we aim to advance both the research data and design thinking literature as well as promote greater collaboration between the two by asking “How might we involve a design thinking approach to understand user needs, collect data, and ultimately develop research data storage solutions that delight our end users?” This subtle shift from “meeting requirements” to “delighting” has allowed us to engineer our research data systems with a focus on human powered computational science.},

abstract = {Quantum computing is an emerging technology with a burgeoning industry and growing workforce needs. The demand for computer scientists with quantum computing knowledge is increasing, as their skills are needed to make quantum computing a scalable and useful resource. However, few computer scientists are formally educated in quantum computing, with most education occurring in physics curricula. Although some open source learning resources and software tools for quantum computing are available, they employ a quantum mechanical, hardware-driven framing that poses accessibility challenges for computing-focused learners. Educational games have seen some success in quantum computing outreach initiatives, particularly in building intuition for quantum mechanical concepts, but rarely relate to computing practices. This submission outlines a doctoral research programme that seeks to develop computing-centred interactions with quantum computing systems, and to explore how play can be leveraged in these interactions as a means of building quantum intuitions in a computing context.},

abstract = {Computing and computing concepts are interconnected with virtually every aspect of daily life and every field of study. However, when teaching new computing concepts to novice programmers, the number of example domain applications that can be presented is extremely limited. In addition, programming assignments where students apply these concepts are typically closed-ended, fully defining the problem to be solved. As a result, there are few opportunities for students to take an active role in creating connections between computing concepts and situations where they can be applied. See Logic in Life exercises are short, non-programming exercises comprised of a logical and a visual component. The exercise format provides opportunities for students to explore and create their own connections between computing concepts and application domains. Further, by sharing these connections with fellow classmates, students are exposed to a breadth of applications for a given concept via a peer learning experience. Student feedback on the impacts of both creating and sharing computing connections via See Logic in Life exercises is presented. Sample See Logic in Life exercises, suitable for use in CS0 or CS1 as in-class, out-of-class, or active learning exercises, are freely available at youtube.com/virt-university.},

abstract = {Formal Methods (FMs) radically improve the quality of the code artefacts they help to produce. They are simple, probably accessible to first-year undergraduate students and certainly to second-year students and beyond. Nevertheless, in many cases, they are not part of a general recommendation for course curricula, i.e., they are not taught — and yet they are valuable.One reason for this is that teaching “Formal Methods” is often confused with teaching logic and theory. This article advocates what we call FM thinking: the application of ideas from Formal Methods applied in informal, lightweight, practical and accessible ways. We will argue here that FM thinking should be part of the recommended curriculum for every Computer Science student, for even students who train only in that “thinking” will become much better programmers. However, there will be others who, exposed to those ideas, will be ideally positioned to go further into the more theoretical background: why the techniques work, how they can be automated, and how new ones can be developed. Those students would follow subsequently a specialised, more theoretical stream, including topics such as semantics, logics, verification and proof-automation techniques.},

We worked with 22 children aged 11 to 14 (9 girls and 13 boys) who completed projects, in a mixed Greek-English summer school. Our thematic analysis identified two key themes around the materiality of interaction design: (i) how materials “talk back” during design promotes computational making skills, and (ii) the interactive role of materiality and construction in supporting computational making. Our research demonstrates the criticality of understanding material properties of e-textiles to encourage children to concentrate on the aesthetic and science concepts of computational making. Finally, a key contribution of this paper is demonstrating the relevance of teaching materiality to allow children to engage with the fundamentals of somaesthetic experiences and embodied interaction as a starting point for age-appropriate tangible interaction design education.},

Drawing from Constructionist perspectives on the relationship between computers and cognition, we analyze interviews with secondary school students at the end of their time in a 2-year, constructionist CS course to better understand how these students’ CS education affected their experiences with computing in their everyday lives. In doing so, we identify three types of experience where students begin to “re-see” technology: respect, curiosity, and an impetus to do more. We analyze these experiences using Constructionist perspectives on computer cultures, material intelligence, and liberatory pedagogy. Finally, we discuss how computational identity development is a unique process mediated by learners' participation in communities of practice and explore implications of this analysis for the goals of K12 CS education.},

abstract = {Computer Science was introduced in the upper secondary curriculum in Ireland in 2018. Initially introduced in 40 pilot schools, it has since expanded and is currently offered in approximately one-third of all schools across the country. Given its recent introduction, it was important to understand the students’ experiences and perceptions of the subject. This study reports on students’ experiences of studying Computer Science in a sample of secondary schools. A qualitative approach was adopted to comprehensively capture students’ insights, including one-to-one semi-structured interviews and other data collection methods that collected student-generated data. The study found that students had positive experiences and perceptions of the subject. Students enjoyed the active and interactive way Computer Science was taught and appreciated the peer learning opportunities that it provided. Students reported developing skills such as creativity, problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration through the active learning approach. The project-based learning, afforded by the Applied Learning Tasks, was welcomed by students, although it also presented a number of challenges. Students opposed the prevalent stereotypical views of Computer Science, claiming that the subject was suitable for all, regardless of gender, prior knowledge, or abilities. The subject was considered relevant not only for those pursuing a career in Computer Science but for all students, as it acted as a vehicle to developing an understanding of the technology-rich society and foster valuable 21st century skills.},

abstract = {Active Learning approaches have found success in CS1 and CS2 courses, consolidating instructional time on the practical, problem-solving aspects of programming. With the increasing availability of generative Artificial Intelligence Assistants, there is a renewed push to focus on higher-order skills beyond syntax and solving programming problems by matching sample outputs.This poster examines the impact of conceptual explanation-based exercises in introductory programming courses through the implementation of a scaffolded semi-flipped classroom. This method is currently in its third semester as a part of an ongoing, iterative, semi-experimental approach to support student resilience in entrance-level courses. This approach aimed to enhance student engagement, retention, and performance by integrating weekly practice sessions and "group-tutoring" sessions facilitated by peer learning assistants. In these sessions, students were encouraged to articulate their problem-solving strategies and the reasoning behind their solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of programming language paradigms and problem-solving techniques.The findings indicate that this method significantly increased classroom engagement, as students became more active participants in their learning journey. Retention rates improved as students became more confident in understanding and applying programming concepts. Overall, student performance saw a notable rise, with students demonstrating a better grasp of programming paradigms and problem-solving approaches beyond rote memorization and matching sample outputs.},

As an assignment, the "How-To" guide merges reflective practice with technical skill development in technical or creative fields, inviting students to author a guide based on insights from prior coursework, personal projects or specific directed challenges. This method emphasizes reciprocal learning by engaging students in a reflective process where they must articulate and analyze their technical learning, thus reinforcing their understanding and evidencing their mastery of the given learning outcome. This technique could be more broadly applicable, building on the large success of online how-to tutorials; but in flipping the emphasis from passive consumption to productive engagement, the discussed assignment encourages a blend of narrative, technical detail, and creative expression, culminating in a resource that benefits both the author, their peers and potentially course development itself. This presentation will explore how the assignment’s framework develops as an extension of the principle of ‘ako’, a Mundefinedori concept emphasizing reciprocal learning. The discussion will focus on its application within the specific educational context of Aotearoa New Zealand and the broader value it offers to creative and technical education.},

abstract = {We describe a new introductory CS curriculum initiative that uses analogies and active engagement to develop students' conceptual understanding before applying the concepts to programming. We believe that traditional coding approaches to introducing computer science concepts rely on students to build their own conceptual understanding, rather than grounding their understanding of concepts in what they know from everyday experiences. Using constructivism as a foundation for this curriculum initiative, our approach builds a framework for student understanding anchored in the physical world using simple games and stories to stimulate mental engagement through embodied learning.For example, we teach the concept of abstraction and representation by presenting the game of Tic-Tac-Toe as an island divided into nine regions, but the middle one you cannot get to by boat, which is the way two teams arrive to the island. After playing the game once and realizing the game is really just Tic-Tac-Toe, the students understand the example is a representation with modified rules and game pieces. Then we talk about how the set of rules for a simple game like Tic-Tac-Toe is an algorithm with instructions for how to play the game, and we use playing the game to explain computation as the execution of an algorithm.Based on observations using analogies and active engagement in 6th grade classrooms, we provide many examples explaining how this curriculum initiative is an engaging, effective, and flexible approach for introducing CS concepts.},

Early work focused on ''physics of video games'' activities for high school physical science and physics while later work has ventured into content for astronomy and high school mathematics. Some of these activities appear on hourofcode.com and in ''instructional supports'' for physical science in Ohio. An important component of our efforts is creating high quality videos that walk through our activities on the STEMcoding youtube channel (http://youtube.com/STEMcoding). These videos frequently feature women and students from underrepresented groups. Ultimately our goal is to encourage high school science and math teachers to integrate computer science and data science content into their subjects, even if they do not have the credentials to teach computer science. This can enhance science and math classes, and as these teachers become comfortable with this approach, some go on to become certified to teach computer science.},

Practical applications include incorporating iterative design processes, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and aligning educational goals with industrial demands. Notably, the study underscores the importance of visual thinking in DT, which aligns with the existing evidence and theory in design cognition research. Future research should explore longitudinal studies to track skill development and investigate the integration of FBS ontology into TPC curriculum. Finally, exploring the cross-disciplinary applications of DT in diverse fields can enhance the understanding and practice of DT.},

abstract = {This practice paper presents a framework that has been successfully used in introductory programming classes to orient students to the nature and purpose of programming, and teachers to the multiple aspects of programming education. Orientation was one of the five key difficulties for novices identified in du Boulay’s landmark 1986 paper, and it can still be an issue for both incoming students and new computing teachers. The framework, known as ABC, presents computing as a modelling activity, with: a multitude of possible problem/task domains, or Application Areas (A); sets of Building Blocks (B), such as programming languages and other computing systems, which can be used for model building; and a set of skills enabling the Creative Construction (C) of a solution, or model, of a problem/task in a particular application area, using a particular building block system. How the ABC Framework can be used to help orient students and structure learning and teaching is presented, as well as insights derived from students and teachers of an introductory programming course where this approach is used.},

abstract = {Montessori pedagogy has a comparatively long tradition of more than 100 years while CS education still is an innovative and future-oriented discipline. Montessori pedagogy is in particular known for its material and accompanying methods, criteria and learning theory. A combination with CS education could therefore advance it towards creating material that allows for self-empowerment of learners in a constructionist way that is also prevalent in current CS education and its research. We therefore conducted a systematic literature review and identified 34&nbsp;papers. First results show that there is a focus on programming and while all educational levels are included, there is a slight tendency towards primary school education. When looking at the specific mentions of the Montessori pedagogy, it is mostly used as a source of inspiration for, for example, creating CS teaching material. Within the results, first conclusions are drawn and finally, future work is suggested.},

abstract = {Temporal Automatic White Balance (TAWB) corrects the color cast within each frame, while ensuring consistent illumination across consecutive frames. Unlike conventional AWB, there has been limited research conducted on TAWB for an extended period. However, the growing popularity of short-form videos has increased focus on video color experiences. To further advance research on TAWB, we aim to address the bottlenecks associated with datasets, models, and benchmarks. 1) Dataset challenge: Currently, only one TAWB dataset (BCC), captured with a single camera, is available. It lacks temporal continuity due to challenges in capturing realistic illuminations and dynamic raw data. In response, we meticulously designed an acquisition strategy based on the actual distribution pattern of illuminations and created a comprehensive TAWB dataset named CTA comprising 6 cameras that offer 12K continuous illuminations. Furthermore, we employed video frame interpolation techniques, extending the captured static raw data into dynamic form and ensuring continuous illumination. 2) Model challenge: Among the two prevailing TAWB methods, both rely on LSTM. However, the fixed gating mechanism of LSTM often fails to adapt to varying content or illuminations, resulting in unstable illumination estimation. In response, we propose CTANet, which integrates cross-frame attention and RepViT for self-adjustment to content and illumination variations. Additionally, the mobile-friendly design of RepViT enhances the portability of CTANet. 3) Benchmark challenge: Currently, there is no benchmark of TAWB methods on illumination and camera types to date. Addressing this, a benchmark has been proposed by conducting a comparative analysis of 8 cutting-edge AWB and TAWB methods with CTANet across 3 typical illumination scenes and 7 cameras from two representative datasets. The dataset and code are available in https://github.com/ChunxiaoLe/CTA-Dataset.},

In this panel, we bring together a collection of experts in the PreK-5 field, including researchers, a curriculum designer, and teachers, to discuss promising practices for including CS instruction in the PreK-5th grades, focusing in particular on PreK-2nd grades. The intended audience for this panel includes researchers and practitioners who are interested in CS in the early elementary and early childhood years. This topic is highly relevant to the SIGCSE community since it brings together teachers, curriculum designers, and researcher perspectives into a shared space to highlight the ways schools, teachers, and researchers can think about successfully adding computer science into young children's education.},

abstract = {Microarchitecture simulators are indispensable tools for microarchitecture designers to validate, estimate, optimize, and manufacture new hardware that meets specific design requirements. While the quest for a fast, accurate and detailed microarchitecture simulation has been ongoing for decades, existing simulators excel and fall short at different aspects: (i) Although execution-driven simulation is accurate and detailed, it is extremely slow and requires expert-level experience to design. (ii) Trace-driven simulation reuses the execution traces in pursuit of fast simulation but faces accuracy concerns and fails to achieve significant speedup. (iii) Emerging deep learning (DL)-based simulations are remarkably fast and have acceptable accuracy, but fail to provide adequate low-level microarchitectural performance metrics such as branch mispredictions or cache misses, which is crucial for microarchitectural bottleneck analysis. Additionally, they introduce substantial overheads from trace regeneration and model re-training when simulating a new microarchitecture.Re-thinking the advantages and limitations of the aforementioned three mainstream simulation paradigms, this paper introduces TAO that redesigns the DL-based simulation with three primary contributions: First, we propose a new training dataset design such that the subsequent simulation (i.e., inference) only needs functional trace as inputs, which can be rapidly generated and reused across microarchitectures. Second, to increase the detail of the simulation, we redesign the input features and the DL model using self-attention to support predicting various performance metrics of interest. Third, we propose techniques to train a microarchitecture agnostic embedding layer that enables fast transfer learning between different microarchitectural configurations and effectively reduces the re-training overhead of conventional DL-based simulators. TAO can predict various performance metrics of interest, significantly reduce the simulation time, and maintain similar simulation accuracy as state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors. Our extensive evaluation shows TAO can reduce the overall training and simulation time by 18.06x over the state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors.},

However, the ways that elementary teachers verbally support CS integration during classroom enactment of STEM+CS projects has rarely been considered in research. This paper uses a descriptive, single case study methodology in the bounded context of a public elementary school to explore how two fifth-grade science teachers implicitly and explicitly support the integration of STEM+CS disciplines within a CS-focused lesson through verbal supports that were either planned in the STEM+CS project curricular materials or added by the teachers. Data sources included transcripts of all whole-class discussions that occurred while the two fifth-grade science teachers co-taught a CS lesson that spanned three fifty-minute class periods to two different classes. Two researchers team coded instances of teachers' verbal support of STEM+CS integration, wrote memos for each instance, and graphed the instances on a four-quadrant, analytic framework which was divided along an axis of explicit or implicit verbal support and an axis of planned or added verbal support. The researchers then grouped their memos by quadrant and used pattern coding to look across instances for emerging themes. Findings include that most instances of verbal support for STEM+CS interdisciplinary integration were added by the teachers and implicitly articulated how disciplinary practices related to each other. Implications include recommendations for ways to help teachers to explicitly support the integration of STEM+CS through CS-focused activities within elementary science classrooms.},

To better understand which misconceptions novice Python programmers commonly hold about scope rules, we pose the question of "To what extent do misconceptions exist even for a simple subset of scope rule features?". The answer to this question can determine the level of complexity of scope rule features the instructor should focus on.We consider a subset of Python that only has non-recursive and non-nested function definitions, scalar variables, and global code that calls the function definitions. We also consider the variable categorization into local variables, parameters, and global variables. We developed an assessment tool that we used as part of the final examination in a CS1 course for three semesters. We found that though there were significant misconceptions for some features, the number of such features is limited. This identification of the common misconceptions for this subset of Python can aid in revising the instructional focus to help future students better understand scope rules.},

abstract = {K-12 computing education research is a rapidly growing field of research, both driven by and driving the implementation of computing as a school and extra-curricular subject globally. In the context of discipline-based education research, it is a new and emerging field, drawing on areas such as mathematics and science education research for inspiration and theoretical bases. The urgency around investigating effective teaching and learning in computing in school alongside broadening participation has led to much of the field being focused on empirical research. Less attention has been paid to the underlying philosophical assumptions informing the discipline, which might include a critical examination of the rationale for K-12 computing education, its goals and perspectives, and associated inherent values and beliefs. In this working group, we conducted an analysis of the implicit and hidden values, perspectives and goals underpinning computing education at school in order to shed light on the question of what we are talking about when we talk about K-12 computing education. To do this we used a multi-faceted approach to identify implicit rationales for K-12 computing education and examine what these might mean for the implemented curriculum. Methods used include both traditional and natural language processing techniques for examining relevant literature, alongside an examination of the theoretical literature relating to education theory. As a result we identified four traditions for K-12 computing education: algorithmic, design-making, scientific and societal. From this we have developed a framework for the exemplification of these traditions, alongside several potential use cases. We suggest that while this work may provoke some discussion and debate, it will help researchers and others to identify and express the rationales they draw on with respect to computing education.},

Prior work has studied various quiz types, such as fill-in-the-gap write-code questions. However, the overall impact of these quizzes is unclear: studies often show utility in the learning phase when enhanced with quizzes, though limited transfer of utility in the post-learning phase. In this paper, we aim to better understand the impact of different quiz types and whether quizzes focusing on diverse skills (e.g., code debugging and task design) would have higher utility. We design a study with Hour of Code: Maze Challenge by code.org as the base curriculum, interleaved with different quiz types. Specifically, we examine two learning groups: (i) HoC-ACE with diverse quizzes including solution tracing, code debugging, code equivalence, and task design; (ii) HoC-Fill with simple quizzes on solution finding. We conducted a large-scale study with 405 students in grades 6--7. Our results highlight that the curriculum enhanced with richer quizzes led to higher utility during the post-learning phase.},

abstract = {Visual thinking with diagrams is a crucial skill for learning and problem-solving in STEM subjects. To improve in this area, students need a variety of visual problems for deliberate practice. However, in our interviews, educators shared that they struggle to create these practice exercises because of limitations of existing tools. We introduce Edgeworth, a tool designed to help educators easily create visual problems. Edgeworth works in two main ways: firstly, it takes a single diagram from the user and systematically alters it to produce many variations, which the educator can then choose from to create multiple problems. Secondly, it automates the layout of diagrams, ensuring consistent high quality without the need for manual adjustments. To assess Edgeworth, we carried out case studies, a technical evaluation, and expert walkthrough demonstrations. We show that Edgeworth can create problems in three domains: geometry, chemistry, and discrete math. These problems were authored in just 15 lines of Edgeworth code on average. Edgeworth generated usable answer options within the first 10 diagram variations in 87% of authored problems. Finally, educators gave positive feedback on Edgeworth's utility and the real-world applicability of its outputs.},

abstract = {As security risks to network systems have grown, red team assessment has emerged as a powerful methodology for discovering vulnerabilities. Such assessments are difficult to master because technical knowledge and experience are needed. Automating the vulnerability assessment of network systems is expected to help network system administrators conduct these assessments easily. The challenges for automating these assessments include accurately addressing many actions, observing network states, and generalizing agent models. In this paper, we propose a framework, called AutoRed, for the automation of red team assessment via strategic thinking using reinforcement learning (RL). Our framework addresses the following challenges: (1) facilitating action determination by adopting a hierarchical RL model via strategic thinking, (2) establishing a method to observe network systems using graph neural networks (GNNs), and (3) investigating the reusability and generalization ability of the proposed model through experiments. We further evaluate the proposed model in an emulated environment constructed on a virtual machine platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model trained on three scenarios simultaneously can be applied 10-40 times more efficiently to various scenarios, including unseen scenarios during training, than the state-of-the-art hierarchical model.},

abstract = {While teacher inquiry has been known for decades to be an effective way of improving practice, teachers often do not have the time or confidence to undertake their own research. This paper describes the research questions that computing teachers chose to investigate when participating in a teacher inquiry project. Results show that teachers are most focused on cognitive outcomes, are concerned with students’ lack of understanding, and are mostly focused on either programming or computing topics in general. While some teachers planned to change their pedagogy, others introduced cross-curricular opportunities to increase interest and understanding. Teachers’ choice of questions can support researchers in developing a research agenda for K-12 computing education.},

abstract = {The Constitution of Brazil and its subsequent laws have established various rights and protections for Indigenous peoples, among them the right to Indigenous schools where their culture and native language must be taught, learned, and preserved as something alive and essential to their well-being. Brazil's National Digital Education Policy, which mandates the teaching of computing in K-12 education, is a recent development not yet implemented in indigenous schools, where access to computers and the Internet is still quite limited. To promote the inclusion of indigenous populations in higher education, the University of Bras\'{\i}lia (UnB), in collaboration with Brazil's National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples, has created an admission pathway dedicated to students from these populations. In 2022, UNB's Computer Science Department welcomed its first three Indigenous students from the Ticuna community in the Amazon region of Brazil. The Ticuna people represent the largest indigenous ethnic group in Brazil. Ticuna students, computer science professors, and computer science students at UnB have collaborated to address the gap in the K-12 teaching of computing in Ticuna communities. This work describes the materials created by the indigenous students for teaching computing in their communities within the context of their culture and language.},

abstract = {Understanding issues of intersectionality in education is vital for creating equitable learning environments. Intersectionality emphasizes the complexity of students' identities, including race, gender, and socioeconomic status, and how they interact to characterize their diverse group membership. Examining data intersectionality underscores students' heterogeneous needs, circumstances, and outcomes, advancing researchers' and policymakers' understanding of the types of interventions that ameliorate disparities for marginalized students. This study examines the intersectional factors influencing K-2 students' coding skills. We employ a hierarchical linear model on a validated pre-and-post coding assessment to examine a year-long Coding as Another Language curriculum for Latine, multilingual, and low-socioeconomic students. Findings indicated initial performance gaps for students with historically marginalized and intersecting backgrounds. After receiving the curriculum, these students demonstrated significant improvement, closing the coding skills gap with their more privileged peers. These findings underscore the importance of investigating and mitigating disparities in coding education for students with intersecting identities.},

abstract = {The genre of “found poetry” encompasses passages of text that were first framed as poetry by someone other than the original writer. But for something to be found, it must first be lost. In an attempt to shed light on the role of computational intelligence in the human creative ecosystem, I argue that many computational generators of poetry function essentially as poetry losers: machines whose central purpose is to arrange units of language, without fully understanding them, in combinations that can later be found to be poetry. This implies a paradox for computational poetry: a poetry machine that too completely understands the poetic effects of its output deprives human readers of the chance to find poetry where the machine did not, fundamentally altering both the reader’s poetic experience and the machine’s utility. I briefly explore the implications of this view, taking computational poetry as a microcosm of “intelligent” machines in creative contexts generally, and discuss what it means to construct an effective poetry loser.},

This work discusses the potential opportunities and challenges of acoustophoretic technology in the Human-Food Interaction (HFI) domain. We envisage that acoustophoretic technology can serve as a versatile platform for emerging computational gastronomy and eating, providing promising new technical solutions with diverse food processing functionalities without requiring multiple specialized kitchen equipment and large spaces, and enhancing the interactivity possibilities in different eating scenarios. We aim to inspire more innovative research ideas and enrich the perspectives on computation and interaction in HFI.},

This is largely due to the rise of data-intensive applications, such as machine learning, online video distribution, astrophysics, and genomics. Moving compute operations closer to the data provides benefits in terms of scaling possibilities and energy efficiency. The development of computational storage devices has been limited by the need for specialized and complex hardware. In this work, we propose a portable Linux-based firmware framework for the development of NVMe computational storage devices. Our firmware runs on a variety of hardware platforms ranging from expensive FPGA solutions to inexpensive off-the-shelf single board computers. The firmware leverages the vast Linux software ecosystem to facilitate the development and prototyping of novel computational storage devices. We benchmark our firmware on multiple hardware platforms and demonstrate its versatility through several computational examples including a content-aware disk image search engine based on natural language processing and AI-driven image recognition.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection in computational workflows is critical for ensuring system reliability and security. However, traditional rule-based methods struggle to detect novel anomalies. This paper leverages large language models (LLMs) for workflow anomaly detection by exploiting their ability to learn complex data patterns. Two approaches are investigated: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where pretrained LLMs are fine-tuned on labeled data for sentence classification to identify anomalies, and (2) in-context learning (ICL), where prompts containing task descriptions and examples guide LLMs in few-shot anomaly detection without fine-tuning. The paper evaluates the performance, efficiency, and generalization of SFT models and explores zero-shot and few-shot ICL prompts and interpretability enhancement via chain-of-thought prompting. Experiments across multiple workflow datasets demonstrate the promising potential of LLMs for effective anomaly detection in complex executions.},

To identify strategies to support K-5 teachers in providing computer science instruction, it is crucial to understand the primary challenges and facilitators that they experience. This study surveyed 1,054 teachers from diverse Texas schools and identified key supports and barriers to integrating new state technology education standards in K-5 classrooms. Teachers completed a survey before participating in a professional development program. The teachers identified facilitators to integrating the standards into their instruction, such as access to technology, professional development, and administrator support. They also shared barriers such as time constraints, lack of curriculum and training, and insufficient technology infrastructure. The findings underscore the need for stronger teacher support systems, including improved resources, more targeted professional development, and enhanced administrator buy-in, to ensure all K-5 students benefit from comprehensive technology education.},

In this spirit, this month we go into more depth into one of the two theses highlighted by the Doctoral Dissertation Award, by Dr. Siddartha Jayanti. (Unfortunately, the other 2023 recipient, Dr. Dean Leitersdorf, could not contribute this time, due to outside constraints.)Dr. Siddartha Jayanti's thesis comprises novel results in the scope of distributed and concurrent synchronization. The thesis, and Siddartha's work in general, is remarkable for both its depth and breadth: as you can see in the overview, the work incorporates technical results spanning from multi-processor synchronization to finding equilibria in multiplayer games! Another remarkable aspect is Siddartha's commitment to broadening participation in STEM, specifically to expanding science availability by writing what appears to be the first research paper in the Telugu language. It is also worth noting that Siddartha is part of the second generation of Distributed Computing researchers from his family. (As readers probably know, his father is Prof. Prasad Jayanti.)The strength and diversity of the 2023 awarded theses, together with the fact that PODC has received a record number of submissions this year, suggest that the future is bright for our area.},

In this pictorial, we contrast widely used kits (i.e., Lego Mindstorms, Sphero, and DASH) with a kit we created in the form of a module embedded in a summer camp, that takes an alternative approach. Most existing kits are designed with clear-cut, narrowly defined end goals for learners to accomplish. The lessons typically do not include teaching design concepts, and do not offer opportunities for crafting, personalization, and storytelling. We offer a more flexible and creative kit design; integrating concepts such as design thinking, iterative design, and collaboration. We illustrate our design process used to craft the kit/module, along with artifacts collected from its use, and discuss how this approach might help support a broader range of groups—particularly those that are underrepresented in STEM.},

abstract = {The hardship students face when beginning to problem solve can lessen motivation and confidence in their programming ability. An initial mitigation step is to explore students’ mindsets when first approaching a programming task, and distinguish between correct/incorrect models of problem-solving. This will help researchers and instructors realize what methods and tools can scaffold students’ problem-solving skill development in programming classrooms. Our goal is to uncover this information by investigating successful problem-solving approaches across the computing and math domains, and exploring whether it is possible to transfer a successful approach from math to the computing domain. We also explore whether students can apply a successful problem-solving strategy, such as problem decomposition, after being reminded or taught that such a strategy exists. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study with high-school students solving math and programming problems. Our data analysis reveals a number of problem-solving strategies in both programming and math, highlights their differences, and demonstrates the transfer problem-solving benefits across domains. We also found that simply instructing students how to apply a problem-solving strategy does not ensure its application. Overall, this research highlights the need to design tools that teach students how to apply successful problem-solving strategies.},

abstract = {Computational approach to politeness is the task of automatically predicting and/or generating politeness in text. This is a pivotal task for conversational analysis, given the ubiquity and challenges of politeness in interactions. The computational approach to politeness has witnessed great interest from the conversational analysis community. This article is a compilation of past works in computational politeness in natural language processing. We view four milestones in the research so far, viz. supervised and weakly supervised feature extraction to identify and induce politeness in a given text, incorporation of context beyond the target text, study of politeness across different social factors, and study the relationship between politeness and various socio-linguistic cues. In this article, we describe the datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in computational politeness research. We also discuss representative performance values and provide pointers to future works, as given in the prior works. In terms of resources to understand the state of the art, this survey presents several valuable illustrations—most prominently, a table summarizing the past papers along different dimensions, such as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.},

abstract = {Object-oriented approach represents a different way of thinking about software development in terms of modularity and abstraction of concepts through the modeling of system components. Within this context, it is essential to address the challenges encountered by students and novices, who often struggle with fundamental object-oriented design concepts. Specifically, from a cognitive point of view, a notable deficiency lies in their grasp of abstraction—a fundamental cognitive pillar that supports software design. There is an evident need to refine research efforts to correct the lack of knowledge revealed by these difficulties in software design, specifically, those related to abstraction. To rectify this knowledge gap, it has been carried out a literature review through qualitative research that is based on the Kitchenham methodology. This study is dedicated to understanding and mitigating the difficulties that novice designers encounter when modeling software systems, with a particular focus on the concept of abstraction. Our research efforts led to the classification of difficulties in software design, as gleaned from the existing literature. Furthermore, we sought to elucidate the varying levels of abstraction perceived by different authors in this context. Among the identified challenges are students’ limited perception of classes as real-world entities, the transition from structural to object-oriented programming paradigms, and the navigation across different levels of abstraction. This study contributes to the field by shedding light on the specific challenges faced by novices in the realm of object-oriented design, with a particular emphasis on the critical aspect of abstraction.},

abstract = {Programming literacy is crucial for current and future generations of young learners, irrespective of their career paths. Programming education is thus essential, making teaching methods and tools to be tailored to the target audience. In this context, contemporary visual programming environments, particularly block-based programming, have become instrumental in introducing programming concepts to young learners. Educational theories such as Constructionism advocate an approach centered on the learner to deepen and motivate learning. In computer science, these theories can be applied by providing hands-on experiences that connect computer science to real-life situations through the manipulation or construction of physical and tangible computational devices. This study explores the impact of creating a smart object for a smart home using block-based programming on young learners' attitudes and perceptions toward programming and their programming skills acquisition. An introductory programming workshop involved 28 8th grade students from a secondary school constructing and programming a smart-lighting object in a smart home setting. Performance, attitude, and perception trajectories were assessed through repeated questionnaires. Our results indicate that constructing and programming a real-life smart object enhances learners' confidence and programming skills. This paper contributes to programming education literature by demonstrating the potential of block-based programming, specifically in the context of state-of-the-art smart technologies, to foster programming skills and develop positive attitudes and perceptions among learners.},

This essay, in turn, can intervene into the technical as well as the social, historical, and political structures that serve as sources of bias.},

abstract = {Nonlocality and its connections to entanglement are fundamental features of quantum mechanics that have found numerous applications in quantum information science.  A set of correlations is said to be nonlocal if it cannot be reproduced by spacelike-separated parties sharing randomness and performing local operations.  An important practical consideration is that the runtime of the parties has to be shorter than the time it takes light to travel between them.  One way to model this restriction is to assume that the parties are computationally bounded.  We therefore initiate the study of nonlocality under computational assumptions and derive the following results:     (a) We define the set NEL (not-efficiently-local) as consisting of all bipartite states whose correlations arising from local measurements cannot be reproduced with shared randomness and polynomial-time local operations.  (b) Under the assumption that the Learning With Errors problem cannot be solved in quantum polynomial-time, we show that NEL=ENT, where ENT is the set of all bipartite entangled states (pure and mixed).  This is in contrast to the standard notion of nonlocality where it is known that some entangled states, e.g. Werner states, are local.  In essence, we show that there exist (efficient) local measurements producing correlations that cannot be reproduced through shared randomness and quantum polynomial-time computation.  (c) We prove that if NEL=ENT unconditionally, then BQP≠PP. In other words, the ability to certify all bipartite entangled states against computationally bounded adversaries gives a non-trivial separation of complexity classes.  (d) Using (c), we show that a certain natural class of 1-round delegated quantum computation protocols that are sound against PP provers cannot exist.},

abstract = {The CC2020 Report highlights the importance of transitioning from knowledge-based to competency-based CS education. Given that proficient programming is considered a foundational skill for CS majors, some researchers have developed top-down qualitative frameworks for assessing programming competency. However, the lack of quantitative competency models makes it challenging to conduct competency-oriented assessments in CS courses, especially for introductory programming courses such as CS1. To address this challenge, our study tracks the learning activities of 209 students in a CS1 course, including 10 formative tests and 44590 code submissions. The five-channel learning sequences (score, engagement, code metrics, programming skills, coding style) are established to capture the knowledge, skill, and dispositions of the CS1 competency model for each student, with profiles in each channel characterized by five indicators: mean values, entropy, turbulence, proficiency, and resilience. This approach enables multi-dimensional competency assessment with visualization throughout the learning process, providing timely guidance for both teaching and learning. This work is a preliminary exploration in CS1 towards quantitative programming competency models in CS education via integrating multidimensional data, employing appropriate data granularity, and visualizing observable patterns.},

abstract = {This article introduces DANSEN, the hardware accelerator component for neoDBMS, a full-stack computational storage system designed to manage on-device execution of database queries/transactions as a Near-Data Processing (NDP)-operation. The proposed system enables Database Management Systems (DBMS) to offload NDP-operations to the storage while maintaining control over data through a native storage interface. DANSEN provides an NDP-engine that enables DBMS to perform both low-level database tasks, such as performing database administration, as well as high-level tasks like executing SQL, on the smart storage device while observing the DBMS concurrency control. Furthermore, DANSEN enables the incorporation of custom accelerators as an NDP-operation (e.g., to perform hardware-accelerated ML inference directly on the stored data). We built the DANSEN storage prototype and interface on an UltraScale+HBM FPGA and fully integrated it with PostgreSQL 12. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NDP approach outperforms software-only PostgreSQL using a fast off-the-shelf NVMe drive and significantly improves the end-to-end execution time of an aggregation operation (similar to Q6 from CH-benCHmark, 150 million records) by ≈ 10.6\texttimes{}. The versatility of the proposed approach is also validated by integrating a compute-intensive data analytics application with multi-row results, outperforming PostgreSQL by ≈ 1.5\texttimes{}.},

abstract = {Blind panoramic image quality assessment (BPIQA) has recently brought new challenge to the visual quality community, due to the complex interaction between immersive content and human behavior. Although many efforts have been made to advance BPIQA from both conducting psychophysical experiments and designing performance-driven objective algorithms, limited content and few samples in those closed sets inevitably would result in shaky conclusions, thereby hindering the development of BPIQA, we refer to it as the easy-database issue. In this paper, we present a sufficient computational analysis of degradation modeling in BPIQA to thoroughly explore the easy-database issue, where we carefully design three types of experiments via investigating the gap between BPIQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA), the necessity of specific design in BPIQA models, and the generalization ability of BPIQA models. From extensive experiments, we find that easy databases narrow the gap between the performance of BPIQA and BIQA models, which is unconducive to the development of BPIQA. And the easy databases make the BPIQA models be closed to saturation, therefore the effectiveness of the associated specific designs can not be well verified. Besides, the BPIQA models trained on our recently proposed databases with complicated degradation show better generalization ability. Thus, we believe that much more efforts are highly desired to put into BPIQA from both subjective viewpoint and objective viewpoint.},

In younger children (5-8 years old) it is especially relevant to explore developmentally appropriate teaching methods. Despite a wide variety of applications and interfaces being developed to introduce computing to young children, evidence as to which are the best pedagogical approaches that capitalise on young children’s cognitive and affective capacities remains under-explored. Grounded cognition (GC) is a theory of cognition and learning which emphasises the role of bodily experiences and our interaction with the environment in shaping thought and understanding. The present paper presents preliminary results of an empirical experience using the EIFFEL model to promote young students’ conceptual understanding. An ethnographic approach is used to explore the model’s implications for teaching and learning a fundamental concept in computing science: sequencing.},

abstract = {According to an ecological affordances perspective, any static curriculum has a set of affordances, and differences in teachers, students, and the teaching environment change how those affordances are viewed and used. Therefore, teaching is a relationship between the curriculum, the teacher, and the students. As such, it is not only possible but expected that a teacher will diverge from the details of a lesson plan to better accommodate the needs of themselves as a teacher and their students as learners.In this study, we report on a mixed-methods investigation that explores the different ways upper-elementary and middle-school (7-13 y.o. students) teachers implement the Scratch-based TIPP&amp;SEE learning strategy and the reasoning for their approaches. As expected, we find that teachers across grade levels often deviate from lesson plan details to cater to their own classrooms. For example, teachers serving younger grades were far more likely to keep scaffolds that lesson plans suggest removing. The varied degree of deviation suggests that the repeated use of a learning strategy, alongside lesson plans that present a variety of scaffolded implementations, is beneficial in enabling teachers to adapt lesson content to serve the needs of their specific classroom.},

abstract = {Currently, in the field of education, a multidisciplinary approach called STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) has emerged, which has been complemented by the culture of "doing", known as the Maker Movement. As a result of this complement, the STEM Maker teaching methodology has emerged, and its application has gained significant relevance due to the contrasting results with traditional teaching methods. In the present work the description of a practical case of teaching applying the STEM methodology is presented. This practice integrated 58 participants, manly students and professors at high school and professional level. The practical approach consisted in obtaining technological products based on the development of software and the implementation of Hardware. The participating population initially lacked the basic concepts required for the practice. However, at the end of the practical course, an analysis was carried out based on surveys applied to the participants in each class (class diary, self-evaluation, and quality interview) and the results showed that the learning acquired in many of the participants was sufficient to develop programming skills and electronics. In addition, the learning experience was more satisfactory as the course progressed because the new skills acquired by the participants generated greater confidence to be able to face the proposed challenges. The elements that the participants highlighted in a positive way were interacting with the components in a physical way, generating programming codes using their own logic, implementing the necessary hardware for an application and being able to visualize in real time the operation of their applications integrated by software and hardware.},

abstract = {Data wrangling, the process of preparing raw data for further analysis in computational notebooks, is a crucial yet time-consuming step in data science. Code generation has the potential to automate the data wrangling process to reduce analysts' overhead by translating user intents into executable code. Precisely generating data wrangling code necessitates a comprehensive consideration of the rich context present in notebooks, including textual context, code context and data context. However, notebooks often interleave multiple non-linear analysis tasks into linear sequence of code blocks, where the contextual dependencies are not clearly reflected. Directly training models with source code blocks fails to fully exploit the contexts for accurate wrangling code generation.To bridge the gap, we aim to construct a high quality datasets with clear and rich contexts to help training models for data wrangling code generation tasks. In this work, we first propose an automated approach, CoCoMine to mine data-wrangling code generation examples with clear multi-modal contextual dependency. It first adopts data flow analysis to identify the code blocks containing data wrangling codes. Then, CoCoMine extracts the contextualized data-wrangling code examples through tracing and replaying notebooks. With CoCoMine, we construct CoCoNote, a dataset containing 58,221 examples for Contextualized Data-wrangling Code generation in Notebooks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset, we finetune a range of pretrained code models and prompt various large language models on our task. Furthermore, we also propose Data-Coder, which encodes data context and code&amp;textual contexts separately to enhance code generation. Experiment results demonstrate the significance of incorporating data context in data-wrangling code generation and the effectiveness of our model. We release code and data at https://github.com/Jun-jie-Huang/CoCoNote.},

Chatbots may employ argumentation with different degrees and in a variety of manners. The present survey sifts through the literature to review papers concerning this kind of argumentation-based bot, drawing conclusions about the benefits and drawbacks that this approach entails in comparison with standard chatbots, while also envisaging possible future development and integration with the Transformer-based architecture and state-of-the-art Large Language models.},

abstract = {Teaching evaluation is a more direct presentation of the results of teaching and learning, so the reform of course assessment has been a necessary discussion item in different reform programs. The construction of a reasonable course assessment system can help motivate students to learn, help teachers to improve teaching strategies and teaching methods, and thus promote the achievement of talent cultivation goals. In this paper, we take "College Computer Fundamentals" course as an example, and build a high-quality classroom evaluation index system reflecting "diversified assessment and evaluation" according to the demand for education, cultivation orientation and the characteristics of teaching content, including four latitude assessment and evaluation programs, including classroom interaction, on-line experiments, and midterm and final exams. After the practical verification of the course construction team, the course assessment data are analyzed and processed by SPSS 20.0 software to comprehensively assess the teaching effect, and it is concluded that the diversified approach is conducive to promoting students' thinking and innovation ability, and is conducive to teachers' comprehensive understanding of the students' learning progress and ability development, so as to achieve the results of scientific guidance for teaching.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of computing technology and increasing dependency on digital information impact the career paths and the lives of all current students. The dynamic nature of technology necessitates ongoing evaluation and adaptation of computer science (CS) curricula and teaching methodologies to prepare a technology-driven workforce. While an abundance of curriculum material is available, this experience paper highlights a project focused on development of resources by teachers to specifically align to the New Jersey Student Learning Standards (NJSLS) for Computer Science and Design Thinking (CSDT). The work was designed by teachers for teachers as part of a professional learning community (PLC). The PLC aimed to provide learning opportunities, resources, and technical assistance to schools and districts. With the diverse demographics of the state, the PLC looked to expand access to equitable high-quality, standards-based computer science education for all K-12 students. The paper describes the methodology to create teacher-focused instructional materials based on a teacher PLC and survey data from 37 respondents, highlighting key insights, limitations, and recommendations for future improvements. This paper thus contributes to the existing literature by reaffirming the need for content resources and underscoring the role teachers play in ensuring computer science instruction is more accessible to teachers new to computer science education.},

Artists have manually achieved this effect by exploiting "microgeometry," i.e., small differences in stitch heights. However, past work in computational 3D knitting does not model or exploit designs based on stitch height variation. This paper establishes a foundation for exploring illusion knitting in the context of computational design and fabrication. We observe that the design space is highly constrained, elucidate these constraints, and derive strategies for developing effective, machine-knittable illusion patterns. We partially automate these strategies in a new interactive design tool that reduces difficult patterning tasks to familiar image editing tasks. Illusion patterns also uncover new fabrication challenges regarding mixed colorwork and texture; we describe new algorithms for mitigating fabrication failures and ensuring high-quality knit results.},

abstract = {Time series data are widely used and provide a wealth of information for countless applications. However, some applications are faced with a limited amount of data, or the data cannot be used due to confidentiality concerns. To overcome these obstacles, time series can be generated synthetically. For example, electrocardiograms can be synthesized to make them available for building models to predict conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia without leaking patient information. Although many different approaches to time series synthesis have been proposed, evaluating the quality of synthetic time series data poses unique challenges and remains an open problem, as there is a lack of a clear definition of what constitutes a “good” synthesis. To this end, we present a comprehensive literature survey to identify different aspects of synthesis quality and their relationships. Based on this, we propose a definition of synthesis quality and a systematic evaluation procedure for assessing it. With this work, we aim to provide a common language and criteria for evaluating synthetic time series data. Our goal is to promote more rigorous and reproducible research in time series synthesis by enabling researchers and practitioners to generate high-quality synthetic time series data.},

These involve a commitment to view human experience in encounters with technology as relational and contingent, and research apparatuses as co-producers rather than passive observers of phenomena. In this paper, we argue that sound is the sensory modality best suited to the investigation of entanglements. Materialist theories of sound and listening guide both the design of a novel interactive sound installation and the methodological approach of a participant study exploring the experience of listening. We present a diffractive analysis whereby micro-phenomenological interview data is read with sonic theories, generating accounts that might otherwise remain mute: the temporal fluctuation and physical feeling of proximity in listener entanglements with sound, somatic intention setting, and plural interpretations of interactivity. Finally, we offer a series of provocations for HCI to embrace qualities of the sonic and consider epistemological positions grounded in other sense modalities.},

abstract = {The landscape of computer science (CS) education in the United States has experienced a significant shift, with a notable emphasis on moving beyond introducing CS courses at the high school level to providing K-8 CS learning experiences. Early exposure to CS fosters interest and the foundational knowledge and skills needed for students to pursue future CS opportunities. However, the concept of equitable access to CS education at the elementary and middle school levels is still relatively nascent. To address the issue, we provide an in-depth analysis of our collaborative endeavor with a local public school district to develop and iteratively refine a professional development experience to enable teachers to implement a CS-integrated lesson in their classrooms. In this paper, we expand on the structure of the educator training experience and highlight strategies for curating and adapting CS lessons. In addition, we critically reflect on the strengths and challenges of this program based on teacher surveys and focus groups, as well as propose potential iterations for the program.},

abstract = {In distributed computing by mobile robots, robots are deployed over a region, continuous or discrete, operating through a sequence of look-compute-move cycles. An extensive study has been carried out to understand the computational powers of different robot models. The models vary on the ability to 1)&nbsp;remember constant size information and 2)&nbsp;communicate constant size message. Depending on the abilities the different models are 1)&nbsp;(mathcal {OBLOT} ) (robots are oblivious and silent), 2)&nbsp;(mathcal {FSTA} ) (robots have finite states but silent), 3)&nbsp;(mathcal {FCOM} ) (robots are oblivious but can communicate constant size information) and, 4)&nbsp;(mathcal {LUMI} ) (robots have finite states and can communicate constant size information). Another factor that affects computational ability is the scheduler that decides the activation time of the robots. The main three schedulers are fully-synchronous, semi-synchronous and asynchronous. Combining the models (M) with schedulers (K), we have twelve combinations MK.In the euclidean domain, the comparisons between these twelve variants have been done in different works for transparent robots, opaque robots, and robots with limited visibility. There is a vacant space for similar works when robots are operating on discrete regions like networks. It demands separate research attention because there have been a series of works where robots operate on different networks, and there is a fundamental difference when robots are operating on a continuous domain versus a discrete domain in terms of robots’ movement. This work contributes to filling the space by giving a full comparison table for all models with two synchronous schedulers: fully-synchronous and semi-synchronous.},

abstract = {Following introducing the Industrial Revolution 4.0 framework in 2013, many industrialised nations have implemented this new industrial paradigm. The smart factory is a fundamental concept imperative for successfully implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Many scholars and specialists contend that the ongoing advancement of smart factories will transform the industrial structure. This study aims to examine the status of smart factories, exploring the development and management of the smart factory during the Industry 4.0 period under the study of system thinking. This work extensively explores the distinctive notion and presents individual anecdotes regarding the development, execution, arrangement, and administration of intelligent factories by individuals. The research employs multiple methodologies, such as system thinking of relevant literature and systematic analysis of the proposed complex project. The findings suggest that incorporating intricate system thinking, appropriate technology integration, efficient simulation and machine learning employment, and a responsive monitoring and feedback mechanism are crucial in establishing and managing intelligent manufacturing facilities. External factors and governing constraints need to be considered during the lifecycle of treating complexity. This report offers a thorough and analytical evaluation of developing the smart factory during the Fourth Industrial Revolution, serving as a scholarly resource for further exploration of related subject areas. A further investigation plans to consider deep data collection.},

abstract = {Quality patient-provider communication is critical to improve clinical care and patient outcomes. While progress has been made with communication skills training for clinicians, significant gaps exist in how to best monitor, measure, and evaluate the implementation of communication skills in the actual clinical setting. Advancements in ubiquitous technology and natural language processing make it possible to realize more objective, real-time assessment of clinical interactions and in turn provide more timely feedback to clinicians about their communication effectiveness. In this paper, we propose CommSense, a computational sensing framework that combines smartwatch audio and transcripts with natural language processing methods to measure selected "best-practice'' communication metrics captured by wearable devices in the context of palliative care interactions, including understanding, empathy, presence, emotion, and clarity. We conducted a pilot study involving N=40 clinician participants, to test the technical feasibility and acceptability of CommSense in a simulated clinical setting. Our findings demonstrate that CommSense effectively captures most communication metrics and is well-received by both practicing clinicians and student trainees. Our study also highlights the potential for digital technology to enhance communication skills training for healthcare providers and students, ultimately resulting in more equitable delivery of healthcare and accessible, lower cost tools for training with the potential to improve patient outcomes.},

abstract = {The integration of digital technology into various sectors has transformed education globally, yet its adoption in Nigeria remains constrained by a lack of adequately trained personnel. This study addresses this gap by developing a Project-Based Arduino Robot Application (PARA) for teaching Robotics Programming to preservice teachers. A Research and Development (R&amp;D) design was employed, and data were collected from thirty-five (35) participants drawn from the Department of Computer and Robotics Education and the ICT Centre at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, using a total sampling technique. Three validated instruments were used: the Robotics Programming Needs Assessment Questionnaire (RPNEQ), PARA Expert Validation Questionnaire (PEVQ), and PARA User Satisfaction Scale (PUSC), with reliability coefficients of 0.87, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively. Data were analysed using mean, standard deviation and One-Sample T-Test. The results showed that effective strategies for teaching and learning programming include hands-on approaches, programming with tangible robotics kits that make learning engaging, using instructional videos, employing simple robotics projects that clarify control structures, and fostering teamwork in programming classes. Based on these findings, PARA was developed as a practical solution. Both experts and users expressed high levels of satisfaction with its design, usability, and educational impact. It is recommended that the Ministry of Education collaborate with schools to adopt project-based Arduino robot applications like PARA to enhance programming education, leveraging its benefits to improve learning outcomes.},

abstract = {Physical computing is a materially rich practice that connects across skills in STEM, design, arts, and creativity. It also offers learners a means of making personally meaningful, computational artifacts that support creative development, resonate with personal identities, and access a history of craft and culture. Yet, physical computing instruction remains a complex instructional practice that requires navigating computation and reasoning, engineering and mechanisms, and creativity and problem-solving between physical and virtual spaces. Spurred by the pandemic, the shift to remote instruction fostered a wave of creativity in physical computing instruction and new lines of inquiry around access and inclusion, resilient learning, and the creativity, craft, and culture found in physical computing. This one-day workshop will convene a network of researchers, educators, and designers to uncover, share and reflect on our creative instructional responses. We will develop a set of agendas for continued innovation and inquiry in creative physical computing education in post-secondary contexts. Our aim is to cross-pollinate research agendas and strengthen educational approaches in critical STEM and design practices.},

abstract = {In today's digital age, characterized by rapid news consumption and increasing vulnerability to propaganda, fostering citizens' critical thinking is crucial for stable democracies. This paper introduces the design of ClarifAI, a novel automated propaganda detection tool designed to nudge readers towards more critical news consumption by activating the analytical mode of thinking, following Kahneman's dual-system theory of cognition. Using Large Language Models, ClarifAI detects propaganda in news articles and provides context-rich explanations, enhancing users' understanding and critical thinking. Our contribution is threefold: first, we propose the design of ClarifAI; second, in an online experiment, we demonstrate that this design effectively encourages news readers to engage in more critical reading; and third, we emphasize the value of explanations for fostering critical thinking. The study thus offers both a practical tool and useful design knowledge for mitigating propaganda in digital news.},

This can result in misconceptions that influence the learning of correct ML concepts. Therefore, this study investigates the misconceptions students hold about the functionality of ML-based applications. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with five students, focusing on their understanding of facial recognition and ChatGPT. The interviews were analyzed using an inductively developed code system and qualitative content analysis. This process identified six key misconceptions held by students: “Programmed Behavior,” “Exactness,” “Data Storage,” “Continuous Learning,” “User-trained Model,” and “Autonomous Data Acquisition”. These misconceptions include the notion that AI learns continuously during application, or that training data is saved and reused later. This paper presents the identified misconceptions and discusses their implication for the design and evaluation of effective learning activities in the context of ML.},

abstract = {Culturally responsive computing (CRC), that centers sociopolitical issues and transformational uses of technology, has been described as valuable for increasing engagement with computing, especially for historically underrepresented minoritized students. But what do high school students think? Through a sociocultural lens prioritizing student voices recorded in 56 interviews over a period of 2 years (1–3 years after students’ first experience with computer science (CS) education through Exploring Computer Science or Advanced Placement CS Principles in high school), this study centers the perspectives of 39 primarily low-income, Latine and Black youth from urban California and rural Mississippi public schools to understand what they perceive as the role of technology in our world and what they subsequently desire of their computing education. While none have studied CRC before, the majority responded with CRC ideas about the kind of pedagogy they believe would make for a more meaningful computing learning experience: They see computing as a form of power that impacts both good and bad in the world and want computing educators to prepare them to take on these issues of equity, ethics, social responsibility, and underrepresentation in the field. The students’ perspectives offer important pedagogical insight into how to support deeper engagement with computing in current CS for All initiatives, while also preparing youth for the rapidly evolving and increasingly complex computing landscape that impacts all of our lives.},

abstract = {Background and Context. The importance of CS to 21st-century life and work has made it important to find ways to integrate learning CS and programming into the regular school day. However, learning CS is difficult, so teachers integrating programming need effective strategies to scaffold the learning. In this study, we analyze students’ log data and apply a novel technique to compare Parsons Problems with from-scratch programming in a middle school science class. Objectives. Our research questions aimed to investigate whether, how, and when Parsons Problems improve learning efficiency for a programming exercise within science, utilizing log data analysis and an automated progress detector (SPD). Method. We conducted a study on 199 students in a 6th-grade science course, divided into two groups: one engaged with Parsons problems, and the other, a control group, worked on the same programming task without scaffolding. Then, we analyzed differences in performance and coding characteristics between the groups. We also adopted an innovative application of SPD to gain a better understanding of how and when Parsons problems helped students make more progress on the coding task, with an objective measure of final student grades. Findings. The experimental group, with scaffolding through Parsons Problems, achieved significantly higher grades, spent significantly less time programming, and toggled less between block category tabs. Interestingly, they ran their code more frequently compared to the control group. The SPD analysis revealed that the experimental group made significantly higher progress in all four quartiles of their coding time. Implications. Our findings suggest that Parsons problems can improve learning efficiency by enhancing novices’ learning experience without negatively impacting their performance or grades, which is especially important when programming is integrated into K12 courses.},

This exposes them to various datafication risks, including harmful profiling, micro-targeting and behavioural engineering. Most existing measures focus on immediate online threats, rather than informing children about these implicit risks. In this paper, we present The KOALA Hero Toolkit, a hybrid toolkit designed to help children and parents jointly understand the datafication risks posed by their mobile apps. Through user studies involving 17 families we evaluate how the toolkit influenced families’ thought processes, perceptions and decision-making regarding mobile datafication risks. Our findings show that KOALA Hero supports families’ critical thinking and promotes family engagement. We identify future design recommendations for family support, featuring ideas such as integrating triggering moments and bonding moments in toolkit designs. This work provides timely inputs on global efforts aimed at addressing datafication risks and underscores the importance of strengthening legislative and policy enforcement of ethical data governance.},

To assist self-studies of novice students, we have developed the JavaScript-based web-client programming learning assistant system (JSPLAS). It offers various types of exercise problems with different learning goals, where any answer from a student is automatically marked in the system. In this paper, we present a design of the phrase fill-in-blank problem (PFP) in JSPLAS. A PFP instance provides a source code for web-client programming where several phrases are blanked out, and requests students to fill them in correctly. A phrase consists of one or multiple elements in the code. The correctness of any answer is verified through string matching with the original phrase. In future works, we will generate PFP instances for basic web-client programming concepts and assign them to students for comprehensive evaluations of the proposal. Besides, we will implement the automatic generation program of a new PFP instance to assist teachers.},

abstract = {Courses in research methods are crucial for developing computing students’ skills, such as critical thinking, analyzing practical evidence, and applying theoretical insights. However, traditional lecture-based approaches often result in low student motivation and engagement. Project-based learning (PBL) offers an alternative by involving students in realistic, team-based projects, yet its effects on learning processes still need to be explored. This paper critically examines the challenges of teamwork that computing students face in a PBL research methods course. Through a case study involving master’s students in computer science by reviewing reflection reports and conducting semi-structured interviews, we extracted and categorized a comprehensive list of challenges using the Holz framework. Our findings indicate that introducing PBL as a teaching approach in a research methods course may result in unique challenges for computing students. Firstly, some teams may have been following the latest technologies and trends while selecting topics for their research projects, resulting in a lack of practicality. Secondly, since some team members may have been more interested in developing software solutions instead of using a practical problem to build an empirical research project, their teams may have selected incorrect research strategies. Thirdly, some teams used an individual incremental approach instead of a collective incremental and iterative approach in their research projects, which may have negatively affected their team activities. We also proposed adding a new layer, "How to do a research project in a team?" to the existing Holz framework to address planning and collaborating challenges in the PBL-driven research methods course.},

abstract = {In this review, we analyze the current state of the art of computational models for in-vehicle User Interface (UI) design. Driver distraction, often caused by drivers performing Non Driving Related Tasks (NDRTs), is a major contributor to vehicle crashes. Accordingly, in-vehicle User Interfaces (UIs) must be evaluated for their distraction potential. Computational models are a promising solution to automate this evaluation, but are not yet widely used, limiting their real-world impact. We systematically review the existing literature on computational models for NDRTs to analyze why current approaches have not yet found their way into practice. We found that while many models are intended for UI evaluation, they focus on small and isolated phenomena that are disconnected from the needs of automotive UI designers. In addition, very few approaches make predictions detailed enough to inform current design processes. Our analysis of the state of the art, the identified research gaps, and the formulated research potentials can guide researchers and practitioners toward computational models that improve the automotive User Interface (UI) design process.},

Recently, scholars called to expand computing education beyond learning to use and create with technologies to think critically and ethically about their potential impacts as a means to encourage the development of a sense of computational empowerment. My research aims to explore this space and opportunities which encourage ethical thinking with youth - specifically adolescents - on and about generative AI, a recent emerging innovation. This exploration will take inspiration from previous work pointing to the efficacy of practices from the field of Philosophy for Children (P4C) as well as recent work pointing to the potential of eliciting ethical thinking through a critical reflection and making framework, and suggest a novel framework to elicit a sense of computational empowerment as youth grow up in our digital world.},

abstract = {Code quality is of universal concern among educators. Refactoring code, i.e., revising the structure of a program without changing its behavior is one approach for improving code quality. Numerous software tools have been created to help students refactor the code they write. Only a few software tutors have been reported in literature that help students proactively learn code quality by solving refactoring problems. But they suffer false positive and false negative grading issues because they allow freehand coding. We investigated whether refactoring tutors that do not allow freehand coding could be used to help students learn about non-trivial anti-patterns. We developed and deployed two software tutors for refactoring problems that are based on the principle of "refactoring without rewriting code", and cover a subset of refactoring problems that can be solved using only deletion, duplication, reordering and token-wise editing of lines of code. We investigated whether students needed to learn the anti-patterns covered by the tutors and whether they benefited from using the tutors. In this experience report, we start by describing the tutors - the list of refactoring concepts covered, the user interface, grading, feedback and usage. We report our experience using the tutors over three semesters, which confirmed that both introductory and advanced students needed and benefited from using the tutors despite the limitations of the tutors' coverage. We reflect on what worked and what did not. The tutors currently cover C++, Java and C#. They are available for free for educational use on the web at auglets.org.},

abstract = {Despite the proliferation of research studies examining elementary computing education worldwide, knowledge regarding the implementation and outcomes of elementary computing education is limited. In this study, we systematically reviewed 45 empirical papers published between January 2015 and December 2021 to establish a holistic understanding of recent research trends, implementation practices, and student outcomes in elementary computing instruction. This review identified three areas of focus that the current literature has explored: 1) curriculum and lesson development; 2) computing tools and learning environment design; and 3) computing pedagogy. In terms of implementation, we identified 1) eight types of subject contexts where computing instruction is implemented; 2) seven types of technologies that are used to engage elementary students in computing; and 3) eight types of learning activities that are implemented. Regarding student outcomes, the current literature reported student outcomes in six dimensions. This review presents the current research landscape of elementary computing education in terms of research trend, implementation practices, and student accomplishment. It showcases the versatility of instructional practices, highlights the progress of current efforts, while also pinpoints potential issues and concerns for future improvement.},

abstract = {Surface-based inflatables are composed of two thin layers of nearly inextensible sheet material joined together along carefully selected fusing curves. During inflation, pressure forces separate the two sheets to maximize the enclosed volume. The fusing curves restrict this expansion, leading to a spatially varying in-plane contraction and hence metric frustration. The inflated structure settles into a 3D equilibrium that balances pressure forces with the internal elastic forces of the sheets.We present a computational framework for analyzing and designing surface-based inflatable structures with arbitrary fusing patterns. Our approach employs numerical homogenization to characterize the behavior of parametric families of periodic inflatable patch geometries, which can then be combined to tessellate the sheet with smoothly varying patterns. We propose a novel parametrization of the underlying deformation space that allows accurate, efficient, and systematical analysis of the stretching and bending behavior of inflated patches with potentially open boundaries.We apply our homogenization algorithm to create a database of geometrically diverse fusing patterns spanning a wide range of material properties and deformation characteristics. This database is employed in an inverse design algorithm that solves for fusing curves to best approximate a given input target surface. Local patches are selected and blended to form a global network of curves based on a geometric flattening algorithm. These fusing curves are then further optimized to minimize the distance of the deployed structure to target surface. We show that this approach offers greater flexibility to approximate given target geometries compared to previous work while significantly improving structural performance.},

However, because harassment is highly contextual and personal, designing effective solutions to this problem can be extremely challenging. This paper examines how harassment-mitigation systems studied in human-computer interaction (HCI) consider victim-centered principles in their design. Through a scoping literature review and close reading of 17 papers, we contribute—(1) a characterization of how novel and existing systems consider victims’ identity characteristics, definitions of harassment, and preferred strategies for dealing with harassment; (2) challenges faced by the systems along these dimensions to surface limitations, gaps, and tensions; (3) practical recommendations for researchers, designers, and practitioners to overcome these challenges. In doing so, we offer potential new directions to positively design computational approaches to addressing online harassment with victim-centered principles in mind.},

isbn = {9798400704840},
abstract = {Given an increased focus on computer science education as a valuable context to teach data science—due in part to the potential of computing for accessing, processing, and analyzing digital datasets—there have been steady efforts to develop kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) curricula that productively engage learners in these academic areas. Bootstrap: Data Science and Exploring Computer Science (ECS) are prominent curricular examples designed to support high school data science access in computing contexts. While these vital efforts have found success bridging computer and data science, there remain growing concerns about how we can ensure that such learning experiences support the demographic and intellectually diverse cohorts of students needed for field innovation, occupational attainment, and public literacy. Challenges to these efforts often persist because existing data sources and activities offered to students are typically shaped by others (e.g., curriculum designers, teachers, etc.) rather than by learners themselves. This results in inquiry-driven questions, processes, and outcomes that can restrict exploration and engagement, as opposed to inherently and authentically linking to learners' diverse personal interests, styles and concerns. Perspectives in culturally responsive computing (CRC) provide viable frames for how to design learning experiences that encourage learner access, empowerment, and personal interests—key features for spurring field diversity through learning. With this imperative and framing in mind, we share our project called "Coding Like a Data Miner" (CLDM), which leverages a social media-based application programming interface (API) to teach learners how to gather, process (or wrangle), analyze and then communicate insights learned from "big data" sets. We describe this design as sandbox data science (SDS)—an approach to computing-based data science that is consistent with CRC perspectives with demonstrated promise in broadening participation and enhancing productivity in computer science education. In this article, we share insights into our rationale and the theoretical perspectives that drive our curricular design. We then provide an overview of the curriculum with case examples of the sorts of pursuits that can be taken up by learners in this context. Finally, we reflect on CLDM and design principles that make SDS a viable approach to broadening computing-based data science participation and productivity. This curriculum and accompanying resources are publicly available for review, use and adaptation at www.abclearninglab.com/cldm.},

abstract = {Touchscreen typing requires coordinating the fingers and visual attention for button-pressing, proofreading, and error correction. Computational models need to account for the associated fast pace, coordination issues, and closed-loop nature of this control problem, which is further complicated by the immense variety of keyboards and users. The paper introduces CRTypist, which generates human-like typing behavior. Its key feature is a reformulation of the supervisory control problem, with the visual attention and motor system being controlled with reference to a working memory representation tracking the text typed thus far. Movement policy is assumed to asymptotically approach optimal performance in line with cognitive and design-related bounds. This flexible model works directly from pixels, without requiring hand-crafted feature engineering for keyboards. It aligns with human data in terms of movements and performance, covers individual differences, and can generalize to diverse keyboard designs. Though limited to skilled typists, the model generates useful estimates of the typing performance achievable under various conditions.},

However, prior HFI research has not yet substantively investigated the dynamic nature of computational food from its creation to consumption, limiting our understanding of the complex interactions among creators, computational food, and consumers. In response, our paper shifts the perspective towards the dynamics of computational food interactions through a study in cooperation with chefs and gastronomists. Utilizing “Dancing Delicacies” as a research artifact – a system that facilitates dynamic dining trajectories – we adopted the concept of “choreography” to unravel the experiential dynamics of computational food. Our study resulted in six themes concerning computational food experiences and detailed four design implications central to culinary choreography. Our work aspires to leverage the choreographic potential of computational food design, paving the way for future HFI innovations.},

abstract = {Nowadays, learning activities have become more interactive and collaborative than ever before. However, it remains unclear what makes the group perform differently in such a learning context. With the empowerment of multimodal data (MMD), we conducted a field study involving 12 groups of children who collaborated during two-day-long classroom activities. This paper reports on a quantitative analysis and temporal explanation concerning the relation between children's performance and their group-level MMD measurements during a collaborative coding session in a design thinking activity. We computed each group's performance based on the created artefacts and compared the groups with better performance than the others. The results demonstrate that high-performing groups show more joint engagement, joint visual attention, and joint emotional intensity of delight, while low-performing groups show significantly more joint emotional intensity of frustration. In addition, the evolution over the four temporal phases showed different patterns between high and low-performing groups. Finally, this paper discusses design and theoretical implications for educators, researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Accessibility research has gained traction, yet ethical gaps persist in the inclusion of individuals with disabilities, especially children. Inclusive research practices are essential to ensure that research and design solutions cater to the needs of all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Working with children with disabilities in Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Robot Interaction presents a unique set of ethical dilemmas. These young participants often require additional care, support, and accommodations, which can fall off researchers’ resources or expertise. The lack of clear guidance on navigating these challenges further aggravates the problem. To provide a basis on which to address this issue, we adopt a critical reflective approach, evaluating our impact by analyzing two case studies involving children with disabilities in HCI/HRI research. Flowing from these, we call for a shift in our approach to ethics in participatory research contexts to one that is processual, situational, and community-led.},

abstract = {Many computer science education efforts promise liberation and equality, but that promise often goes unfulfilled. Teaching computation through E-textiles has been one way to achieve this promise because it has increased student engagement and enabled identity work. Although some approaches to teaching CS through E-textiles have been demonstrated as effective, there is not yet work using a programmable electronic embroidery machine (computational embroidery), or work that makes culture itself a topic of learning. In a six-week summer school course, we explored this opportunity, teaching a culture-centric embroidery class that combined hand embroidery and computational embroidery. Students incorporated their identities into their projects by using a block-based coding language to create embroidered patterns. They enthusiastically engaged with the programming aspects of the course and sought to make complicated and beautiful work that interwove their diverse cultures and identities. This paper offers insights into what it is like to teach computing with a cultural lens. Our curriculum and pedagogy offer instructors a template to incorporate these technologies and topics into their courses.},

abstract = {Since Seymour Papert's work with the Logo programming language in the 1960s, there has been a prevailing belief in the effectiveness of visual programming environments for teaching programming to children and novices. As these platforms evolved and became more prevalent, using block programming to teach children and beginners became increasingly more common. However, modern block programming platforms like Scratch and Code.org excessively restrict educators by not allowing them to create custom exercises in the platform. They also tend to make programming a solo activity, not allowing for collaboration and cooperation between learners (Scratch is an exception in this regard). Additionally, they are usually located in standalone websites instead of being implemented in locations that students already frequent regularly. Having identified these gaps in the field of block programming environments, this paper proposes NextBlocks, a new block programming platform implemented as a Moodle plugin. This platform enables educators to create custom exercises, emphasizing social perception and collaboration features. It supports features that are uncommon in block programming environments, contributing to a more interactive and engaging learning experience. Furthermore, being integrated into the Moodle Learning Management System makes NextBlocks more easily accessible within the educational framework. As an open-source platform, besides solving current challenges, it can also serve as a foundation for future expansion by the education community. This paper explores some of the unique features of NextBlocks, presents a case study on the platform, and discusses its potential contributions to enhancing programming education for beginners within a collaborative learning environment.},

abstract = {We are collaborating with a nonprofit organization to train high school Career Technical Education (CTE) teachers to teach computer science courses. In the United States, many CTE teachers are not automatically licensed to teach CS. The traditional pathway to licensure requires 18 credits of CS at a university, which is impractical for teachers while working full-time. Another pathway to licensure is taking the Praxis CS test, which in many states gives teachers an add-on endorsement in computer science. One of the biggest challenges for our teachers is learning how to program with the pseudocode used on the test. We have created an online development environment, named Praxly, that visualizes and runs the pseudocode, providing a space in which teachers can practice. Praxly supports both a text-based editor and a block-based editor, and the editors are synchronized with each other. This poster highlights Praxly's features and implementation details, outlines early research results, and discusses next steps for the project.},

abstract = {The present article introduces and implements an initial validation for the Perceived Artificial Intelligence Literacy Questionnaire (PAILQ-6), a brief tool designed to assess individuals' self-perceived AI literacy. Amidst the growing integration of AI in various aspects of life and its ethical implications, understanding AI becomes crucial for effective interaction with AI technologies. The PAILQ-6 emerges in response to the need for an accessible instrument that evaluates general AI literacy without compromising on clarity or depth, suitable for both academic and practical applications. This paper presents the development process of the PAILQ-6, consisting of six items derived from established components of AI literacy, structured as a seven-point Likert scale for easy administration and digital compatibility. The validation study was conducted from data of a gender-balanced sample of 232 UK adults. The article demonstrates the PAILQ-6's reliability and validity through exploratory factor analysis, showing a two-factor structure. The findings reveal the scale's good internal consistency and convergent validity. The study highlights demographic predictors of AI literacy perceptions, indicating a possible gender disparity and the positive influence of higher education on perceived AI competency.},

Students nearly universally find this course frustrating and challenging as it often requires formal proofs and reasoning. We in the CER community have long had issue with determining where the underlying cognitive barriers are with students in these courses, and how to address them. Various strategies–such as in-class examples, lecture techniques, course structure adjustments, and visual aids–have been explored. However, none have led to substantial progress in identifying the core issues. In this opinion article I give my hypothesis as to what I believe the central fundamental issue is, and that it has not yet been explored within a CER setting.

abstract = {Pair programming is an effective instructional format in programming education for adolescents. Within pair programming, three potential gender combinations may arise: Boy-Boy (BB), Girl-Girl (GG), and Boy-Girl (BG). This study explores the impact of different gender pairings on the programming self-efficacy and collaborative attitudes of sixth-grade students in rural elementary schools. A total of 82 novices (34 girls and 48 boys) voluntarily formed three types of pairs—BB, GG, and BG—to engage in pair programming using Scratch. The course spanned two months, comprising a total of nine sessions. Surveys on programming self-efficacy and collaborative attitudes were administered to all students after the fifth and ninth sessions. Our research brought to light significant improvements in programming self-efficacy for BB pairs, suggesting that male students learning programming with same-gender partners experienced noteworthy enhancements in their perceived programming abilities. Conversely, students in GG and BG pairs did not display significant changes in their programming self-efficacy. Additionally, all students demonstrated optimal collaborative attitudes when engaged in pair programming with same-gender partners. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of programming self-efficacy and collaborative attitudes within the framework of pair learning. The findings hold the potential to offer valuable insights for educators and curriculum designers aiming to establish inclusive and effective learning environments in rural elementary programming education.},

This poster describes an approach to integrate theoretical computer science concepts, such as computability and algorithmic complexity, in the context of high school physics courses, along with a variety of educational activities to implement this approach and allow students to reason instinctively about computable and non-computable problems. This novel approach allows us to broaden students' exposure to complex ideas in theoretical computer science, within a familiar subject and in a more natural and intuitive way. All the problems and activities are framed within courses in Physics, but are clearly related to computing problems in other subjects within the K-12 curriculum.},

However, implementing integrated CS lessons continues to face barriers such as the lack of high-quality instructional resources and limited guidance for educators.The checklist, developed from established curricular rubrics and refined through multiple iterations, contains 47 criteria organized across five key categories. Piloted with educators, the checklist addressed gaps in existing resources by providing clear, research-based guidance that supports novice and experienced educators. Feedback from educators led to refinements that improved the checklist's clarity and usability.

abstract = {Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), involving chest-to-chest skin contact between an infant and caregiver, is proven to be an effective intervention for preterm and full-term infants. Accurate monitoring of KMC duration and infant's vital signs during KMC is clinically important. Existing monitoring methods, however, rely on manual efforts and require rigid sensors or wires/electrodes on the infant's body. We propose Joey, a fabric-based approach to continuously monitor KMC duration and two vital signs essential to an infant's well-being: heart rate and respiration rate. Joey is a soft fabric necklace worn by the caregiver. It leverages the transmission of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals across individuals during skin-to-skin contact. With a minimalist fabric sensor structure, Joey measures KMC duration via the presence of mixed ECG signals. It then isolates the infant's ECG from this mixture with a proposed signal extraction algorithm and employs a diffusion-based denoising model to mitigate motion artifacts, enabling reliable inference of infant's vital signs. We fabricate Joey prototypes with off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance with user studies. Results demonstrate that Joey achieves an average F1 score of 96% for KMC duration measurement, and clinically-acceptable accuracy in infant's vital sign estimation with a mean absolute error of 2.3 beats per minute and 2.9 breaths per minute in estimating heart rate and respiration rate. Clinical interviews further confirm the usability of Joey's sensing fabric for infant skin. A demonstration video of Joey is available at: mobilex.cs.columbia.edu/joey},

abstract = {Scientists use complex multistep workflows to analyze data. However, reproducing computational experiments is often difficult as scientists’ software engineering practices are geared towards the science, not the programming. In particular, reproducing a scientific workflow frequently requires information about its execution. This information includes the precise versions of packages and libraries used, the particular processor used to perform floating point computation, and the language runtime used. This can be extracted from data provenance, the formal record of what happened during an experiment. However, data provenance is inherently graph-structured and often large, which makes interpretation challenging. Rather than exposing data provenance through its graphical representation, we propose a textual one and use a large language model to generate it. We develop techniques for prompting large language models to automatically generate textual summaries of provenance data. We conduct a user study to compare the effectiveness of these summaries to the more common node-link diagram representation. Study participants are able to extract useful information from both the textual summaries and node-link diagrams. The textual summaries were particularly beneficial for scientists with low computational expertise. We discuss the qualitative results from our study to motivate future designs for reproducibility tools.},

abstract = {The authors present and evaluate an unplugged activity to introduce parallel computing concepts to undergraduate students. Students in five CS classrooms used a deck of playing cards in small groups to consider how parallelization can improve performance and how improvement decreases with increased parallelization. Before and after the activity, students took a short survey about their solution and their ideas about parallelism. The authors carried out this activity in seven courses at five institutions in the 2023-2024 academic year. The results showed that students had an increased appreciation for parallelization and this type of activity.},

abstract = {Welcome to the 55th annual SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS 2024)! This year, we have returned to Portland, Oregon. We hope that, like us, you are looking forward to a highly productive and engaging symposium that provides ample opportunity to renew old relationships, build new connections, and learn about the latest advances in our field. While we are sure that there will be a few surprises along the way, we hope and expect that we won't experience anything nearly as disruptive as the opening days of the pandemic, which occurred when we last tried to gather here in 2020.Our theme for this year's symposium is "Blazing New Trails in CS Education." This broad theme captures the exceptional work being performed by this community to enhance our teaching, improve our assessments, attract diverse students, and all of the other laudable projects, initiatives, and undertakings that affect positive change. The breadth of the program is substantial - there truly should be something for everyone. In fact, your biggest challenge may be deciding which session to attend in each time slot because there is so much going on! We know that many of you want to attend as many sessions as possible while you are here in Portland, but we encourage you to also find a little bit of time for yourself so that you leave Portland refreshed, renewed and encouraged, rather than exhausted or burnt out.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel technique of computational art with mandala—an iconic heritage of Indian folk art. Its novelty lies in several fundamental steps. The first one is fixing the asymmetries and the imperfections in a hand-drawn piece of art based on the notion of a primitive map. The primitive map is described using a novel concept of geometric salience—a set of well-defined salient points on the frontier polygon of a primitive—characterizing the concavities and convexities present in the primitive. The primitive map is also used for the vectorization of a mandala and its succinct representation as a mandala sector graph (MSG), which eventually results&nbsp;in efficient graph operations on an existing artwork to create a new piece of art. The use of frontier polygons in different steps of the algorithm makes it robust and efficient. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the potential and versatility of the proposed technique.},

abstract = {Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling for knowledge graphs building, the workshop targets communities focusing on the analysis of online discourse, relying on methods from machine learning, natural language processing, large language models and Web data mining.},

abstract = {Empowering artificially intelligent agents with capabilities that humans use regularly is crucial to enable effective human-agent collaboration. One of these crucial capabilities is the modeling of Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning: the human ability to reason about the mental content of others such as their beliefs, desires, and goals. However, it is generally impractical to track all individual mental attitudes of all other individuals and for many practical situations not even necessary. Hence, what is important is to capture enough information to create an approximate model that is effective and flexible. Accordingly, this paper proposes a computational ToM mechanism based on abstracting beliefs and knowledge into higher-level human concepts, called abstractions, similar to the ones that guide humans to effectively interact with each other (e.g., trust). We develop an agent architecture based on epistemic logic to formalize the computational dynamics of ToM reasoning. We identify important challenges regarding effective maintenance of abstractions and accurate use of ToM reasoning and demonstrate how our approach addresses these challenges over multiagent simulations.},

However, creating slides to communicate analysis results from these notebooks is quite tedious and time-consuming. Researchers have proposed automatic systems for generating slides from notebooks, which, however, often do not consider the process of users conceiving and organizing their messages from massive code cells. Those systems ask users to go directly into the slide creation process, which causes potentially ill-structured slides and burdens in further refinement. Inspired by the common and widely recommended slide creation practice: drafting outlines first and then adding concrete content, we introduce OutlineSpark, an AI-powered slide creation tool that generates slides from a slide outline written by the user. The tool automatically retrieves relevant notebook cells based on the outlines and converts them into slide content. We evaluated OutlineSpark with 12 users. Both the quantitative and qualitative feedback from the participants verify its effectiveness and usability.},

While much work has investigated the productivity of computational modeling with respect to students’ development of scientific content knowledge, less work has focused on students’ development of knowledge and skills for participation in computational modeling practices. A first step in understanding how these practices develop is examining students’ activity in the context of computational modeling environments with attention to the productive moves they make. These moves can provide insight into the knowledge they bring to their learning, which may be foundational to the development of more sophisticated engagement in computational modeling practices. This paper presents empirical results of an investigation of the knowledge one student brings to her interaction with a computational modeling microworld as she models the spread of disease.},

However, traditional methods based on sensory data alone fall short due to the interplay between users’ latent cognitive states and emotional responses. To address this, we introduce a computational cognitive model that simulates emotion as a continuous process, rather than a static state, during interactive episodes. This model integrates cognitive-emotional appraisal mechanisms with computational rationality, utilizing value predictions from reinforcement learning. Experiments with human participants demonstrate the model’s ability to predict and explain the emergence of emotions such as happiness, boredom, and irritation during interactions. Our approach opens the possibility of designing interactive systems that adapt to users’ emotional states, thereby improving user experience and engagement. This work also deepens our understanding of the potential of modeling the relationship between reward processing, reinforcement learning, goal-directed behavior, and appraisal.},

Data consist of focus group interviews and observations. Analysis, guided by critical, humanizing theory, included coding, analyzing, and interpreting data through an iterative process. Key project concepts and a lens of RPs framed code creation and the development of the findings. Findings illustrate how students experienced a sense of belonging that connected into their cultural identities, inspired engagement, and nourished their psychological/emotional wellbeing; and how actual and potential outcomes are related to persistence in computer science (CS), increase in CS content knowledge, and developing a CS identity.},

abstract = {Photography remains an expert area requiring right focus, exposure, composition, and even post-processing. Yet, robotic automation can enable precise camera manipulation, focus and exposure adjustment, camera composition, and post-processing by leveraging state-of-the-art computational photography. Existing proposals for robotic photography focus on adjusting camera angles for static portraits or developing image evaluation metrics, thus falling short in capturing dynamic human robot interactions. This paper describes the design and implementation of Snapbot, a human robot interaction system designed specifically for computational photography. Snapbot dynamically detects face and pose for exposure and focus and interactively controls robot arm for camera composition to perform image scoring and enhancing. As perception, control, and computational photography form an end-to-end pipeline, Snapbot promises a new future in which image focus, exposure, composition, and generation can be jointly optimized as a unified process. We have implemented and deployed Snapbot on a UR3 demonstrating the mean image quality score is 1.51X compared to aesthetic visual analysis dataset. We also perform ablation study to analyze the impact of each stage of Snapbot both visually and quantitatively.},

Our research focuses on three areas: curriculum, teacher-professional learning and policy. The denouement of this aims to identify trends and shortfalls for AI in and for K-12 informatics education. We will systematically review the current literature to identify themes and emerging trends in AI education at K-12. This will be done under two facets, curricula and teacher-professional learning. In addition, we will conduct interviews and surveys with educators and AI experts. Next, we will examine the current policy (such as the European AI Act, and European Commission guidelines on the use of AI and data in education and training as well as international counterparts). Policies are often developed by both educators and experts in the domain, thus providing a source of topics or areas that may be added to our findings. Finally, by synthesising insights from educators, AI experts, and policymakers, as well as the literature and policy, our working group seeks to highlight possible future trends and shortfalls.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss concepts in games for and beyond entertainment to promote innovative designs in learning games. When it comes to designing learning games, pedagogies are regarded as a standalone field. This means that global pedagogical theories, including those outside the context of learning games, can be investigated. These theories are crucial for creating efficient learning experiences. Similarly, we argue that games should be investigated holistically, as a field spanning beyond learning games, to design engaging game experiences in learning games. Studies on games for entertainment can enrich the design of games beyond entertainment with new nuances and approaches.On these grounds, we explore a new perspective on failure inspired by Game Studies, shedding light on the concept of "intrinsically integrated games" in the game-based learning discipline. Next, we design a game prototype in which the failure state is used to turn notional failure into a playful learning activity. Subsequently, we briefly introduce a pilot experiment. The experiment was conducted with a functional version of the prototype in Spring 2024 to demonstrate that misspelling and mispronunciation—viewed as failures—can enhance engagement and be a valuable part of games for beginner readers.},

To enhance GUI design and interaction experience on GUIs, it is important to understand GUIs and understand how individuals interact with them. Consequently, my thesis focuses on applying computational approaches to improve our understanding of GUIs and user interactions. First, I introduce novel GUI representations to capture the visual, spatial, and semantic factors of GUIs and improve the performance of downstream GUI tasks. Second, I simulate how users visually engage with GUIs to understand user interactions to help inform the design of GUI representations. Third, based on the understanding of GUIs and interactions on GUIs, I develop language language representations aimed at assisting users in understanding and more effectively interacting with GUIs.},

This study explores the implementation of AI-Lab, a framework designed to guide students in the effective and ethical use of generative AI, in this case ChatGPT, in academic settings without compromising skill development. Conducted during Spring 2024, our use of the intervention targeted over 500 Computer Science and Data Science majors enrolled in their major-specific Data Structures and Algorithms courses. The AI-Lab framework enabled students to develop both conceptual questions and c++ and Python programs by interacting with ChatGPT and iteratively correcting its errors. Focus groups and post-intervention surveys revealed a generally positive experience. Students appreciated the ability to leverage AI for tasks outside their major, recognizing the value of understanding correct solutions through AI-assisted programming. Moreover, the guided use of generative AI by professors alleviated concerns regarding academic dishonesty, fostering a supportive learning environment. Despite these benefits, students expressed awareness of the potential drawbacks of over-reliance on AI, noting the risk of impeding their professional growth. Nevertheless, they acknowledged the practical utility of AI for non-major related tasks. This study highlights the importance of incorporating structured AI training in curricula to balance skill development and ethical AI usage, offering insights for broader applications in higher education.},

This gap highlights a significant need to introduce knowledge, awareness, and empathy regarding the challenges people with disabilities face with inaccessible software to K-8 students, as well as to present accessible software solutions. We conducted interviews with 21 K-8 students to gauge their current accessibility knowledge, observed their performance when playing simulation games developed to teach accessibility, and asked them about their experience with the gameplay and its impact on their accessibility awareness. Our findings revealed a notable lack of accessibility education in current K-8 curricula. However, after engaging with the accessibility games, participants showed a marked increase in their curiosity and awareness of the need for accessible design. Our study advances the goal of integrating accessibility education into early computer science education to foster a more inclusive future technological landscape.},

One increasingly popular format is tutorial videos, particularly those based on Jupyter notebooks, which offer an intuitive interpretation of code and vivid explanations of analytical procedures. However, creating such videos requires a diverse skill set and significant manual effort, posing a barrier for many analysts. To bridge this gap, we introduce an innovative tool called NotePlayer, which connects notebook cells to video segments and incorporates a computational engine with language models to streamline video creation and editing. Our aim is to make the process more accessible and efficient for analysts. To inform the design of NotePlayer, we conducted a formative study and performed content analysis on a corpus of 38 Jupyter tutorial videos. This helped us identify key patterns and challenges encountered in existing tutorial videos, guiding the development of NotePlayer. Through a combination of a usage scenario and a user study, we validated the effectiveness of NotePlayer. The results show that the tool streamlines the video creation and facilitates the communication process for data analysts.},

We prototyped three computational information subsidies into an interactive tool that we used as a probe to better understand how such a tool may offer utility or more broadly shape the practices of professional science journalists. Our findings highlight central considerations around science journalists' user agency, contexts of use, and professional responsibility that such tools can influence and could account for in design. Based on this, we suggest design opportunities for enhancing and extending user agency over the longer-term; incorporating contextual, personal and collaborative notions of newsworthiness; and leveraging flexible interfaces and generative models. Overall, our findings contribute a richer view of the sociotechnical system around computational news discovery tools, and suggest ways to improve such tools to better support the practices of science journalists.},

abstract = {This study investigates the role of managerial coaching in mitigating employee turnover intentions. The investigation utilizes a computational framework to assess the mediating role of organizational commitment and the moderating impact of leader-member exchange (LMX) in this context. Leveraging cross-sectional survey data from diverse industries, advanced computational techniques, including Lasso regression analysis, are applied to identify the intricate relationships between managerial coaching, LMX, and turnover intentions. The computational analysis reveals a significant negative correlation between managerial coaching and turnover intentions, with organizational commitment serving as a partial mediator. Additionally, the study employs computational models to explore how LMX moderates the influence of managerial coaching on organizational commitment. The findings highlight the predictive power of computational approaches in identifying key determinants of employee turnover, emphasizing the vital roles of managerial coaching and LMX. This research provides a novel computational perspective on the mechanisms through which coaching, and leader-member relationships translate into reduced turnover intentions, offering actionable insights for organizations seeking to minimize voluntary turnover. Furthermore, it contributes to the discourse on integrating leadership concepts into turnover prediction models and elucidates the computational underpinnings of how develop-mental leadership influences employee attitudes and behaviors.},

abstract = {The prevalence of data across all disciplines and the large workforce demand from industry has led to the rise in interest of data science courses. Educators are increasingly recognizing the value of building communities of practice and adapting and translating courses and programs that have been shown to be successful and sharing lessons learned in increasing diversity in data science education. We describe and analyze our experiences translating a lower-division data science curriculum from one university, University of California, Berkeley, to another setting with very different student populations and institutional context, University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). We present our findings from student interviews across two semesters of the course offering at UMBC specifically focusing on the challenges and positive experiences that the students had in the UMBC course. We highlight lessons learned to reflect on the existing large scale program at UC Berkeley, its adaptation and opportunities for increasing diversity in new settings. Our findings emphasize the importance of adapting courses and programs to existing curricula, student populations, cyberinfrastructure, and faculty and staff resources. Smaller class sizes open up the possibility of more individualized assignments, tailored to the majors, career interests, and social change motivations of diverse students. While students across institutional contexts may need varying degrees of support, we found that often students from diverse backgrounds, if engaged deeply, show significant enthusiasm for data science and its applications.},

publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {As generative foundation models improve, they also tend to become more persuasive, raising concerns that AI automation will enable governments, firms, and other actors to manipulate beliefs with unprecedented scale and effectiveness at virtually no cost. The full economic and social ramifications of this trend have been difficult to foresee, however, given that we currently lack a complete theoretical understanding of why persuasion is costly for human labor to produce in the first place. This paper places human and AI agents on a common conceptual footing by formalizing informational persuasion as a mathematical decision problem and characterizing its computational complexity. A novel proof establishes that persuasive messages are challenging to discover (NP-Hard) but easy to adopt if supplied by others (NP). This asymmetry helps explain why people are susceptible to persuasion, even in contexts where all relevant information is publicly available. The result also illuminates why litigation, strategic communication, and other persuasion-oriented activities have historically been so human capital intensive, and it provides a new theoretical basis for studying how AI will impact various industries.},

abstract = {Random testing approaches work by generating inputs at random, or by selecting inputs randomly from some pre-defined operational profile. One long-standing question that arises in this and other testing contexts is as follows: When can we stop testing? At what point can we be certain that executing further tests in this manner will not explore previously untested (and potentially buggy) software behaviors? This is analogous to the question in Machine Learning, of how many training examples are required in order to infer an accurate model. In this paper we show how probabilistic approaches to answer this question in Machine Learning (arising from Computational Learning Theory) can be applied in our testing context. This enables us to produce an upper bound on the number of tests that are required to achieve a given level of adequacy. We are the first to enable this from only knowing the number of coverage targets (e.g. lines of code) in the source code, without needing to observe a sample test executions. We validate this bound on a large set of Java units, and an autonomous driving system.},

abstract = {Current trust and reputation models continue to have significant limitations, such as the inability to deal with agents constantly entering or exiting open multi-agent systems (open MAS), as well as continuously changing behaviors. Our study is based on CA, a previously proposed decentralized computational trust model from the trustee's point of view, inspired by synaptic plasticity and the formation of assemblies in the human brain. It is designed to meet the requirements of highly dynamic and open MAS, and its main difference with most conventional trust and reputation models is that the trustor does not select a trustee to delegate a task; instead, the trustee determines whether it is qualified to successfully execute it. We ran a series of simulations to compare CA model to FIRE, a well-established, decentralized trust and reputation model for open MAS, under conditions of continuous trustee and trustor population replacement, as well as continuous change of trustees‟ abilities to perform tasks. The main finding is that FIRE is superior to changes in the trustee population, whereas CA is resilient to the trustor population changes. When the trustees switch performance profiles FIRE clearly outperforms despite the fact that both models‟ performances are significantly impacted by this environmental change. Findings lead us to conclude that learning to use the appropriate trust model, according to the dynamic conditions in effect could maximize the trustor's benefits.},

abstract = {GPUs are widely used to accelerate many important classes of workloads today. However, in this work, we observe that several important emerging classes of workloads, including simulation engines for deep reinforcement learning and dynamic neural networks, are unable to fully utilize the massive parallelism that GPUs offer. These applications tend to have kernels that are small in size, i.e., have few threads and thread blocks that cannot saturate the GPU’s compute resources. Executing independent kernels concurrently is a promising approach to improve parallelism and utilization. However, this inter-kernel concurrency is difficult to leverage in such workloads with existing approaches: First, the inter-kernel dependencies and computational graph are input-dependent and vary each time the application is executed. Second, the computational graphs tend to be irregular, requiring fine-grain scheduling and synchronization; thus incurring significant synchronization overheads if kernel execution is parallelized. In this work, we propose ACE, a new framework that enables lightweight detection of inter-kernel dependencies and low overhead kernel scheduling at runtime. The key idea behind ACE is to perform inter-kernel dependency checks for a small window of kernels at runtime, similar to out-of-order instruction scheduling. This enables concurrent execution of kernels in applications whose computational graphs are input-dependent and require fine-grained scheduling. We propose ACE-SW, a software-only open-source implementation of ACE and ACE-HW, a hardware-software cooperative implementation. ACE-HW further reduces synchronization overheads by reducing communication between the CPU and GPU. We evaluate ACE for deep RL simulation engines and dynamic and static DNNs on both real hardware and a GPU simulator. We demonstrate speedups of up to 2.19 \texttimes{} (1.56 \texttimes{} on average) by improving GPU utilization with concurrent kernel execution.},

Fast forward to 2024, and 41 states now have K-12 CS standards (and one has high school CS standards only). In preparation for writing an updated set of standards, CSTA is engaging in three stages of work: reimagining CS for high school students, conducting a crosswalk of K-12 CS standards across all 50 states compared to the CSTA standards (2017), and engaging in the technical process of defining final standards content via research and revision. All three stages draw significantly from the community of practitioners, researchers, curriculum designers, postsecondary faculty, and other interested parties. They also draw significantly from research published since the last revision to take into account the current evidence on learning computer science. In this poster, we describe our process for building the groundwork of knowledge for revising the standards, share highlights of the results to date, and describe how this data will be used to inform the upcoming revision of the CSTA standards.},

The project aimed to test the universities’ appetite and ability to implement mechanisms awarding university credits to those undertaking these bootcamps; so-called micro-credentials. As a result of this project, 349 learners were recruited onto 16 bootcamps. Six of these bootcamps saw the learners obtain university credits; the remaining ten bootcamps were non-credit-bearing which nonetheless provided essential upskilling opportunities. This paper reflects on the outcomes of this project, discussing the challenges faced, delivery mechanisms used, learner demographics, completion rates, and future ambitions.},

abstract = {Sports spaces are being increasingly used for enabling a variety of computing education opportunities. This work often aims to support socially and disciplinarily minoritized communities, often children of color with specific cultural practices and identities around sports. In this work, we focus on how these experiences can be extended to support youth in developing lasting long term skills around computational making using athletic interest and participation as a jumping off point. We focus on how such a making process can enhance and augment learners’ sports understanding, and by extension sports performance; as well as how their sports interest helps them encounter and make sense of different computing concepts. In this paper, we discuss working with a student athlete, his journey of designing and bringing to life ideas around sports technologies, through physical computing and prototyping technologies. We employed a user-centered design approach for designing the learning experience, and emerging methods for assessing learning in making experiences. We blend data around his making experience with observations and interview data around his sports experiences. We find that the process of making augmented his ability to think more deeply about elements of his practice (e.g., strategies of play, ecosystem, and teamwork) and a deeper appreciation of science and technology in the real world. This work contributes an additional lens on how making can serve as a powerful process to realize new possibilities involving computing education in cultural-sustaining computing learning environments.},

Moreover, the metric comparing the computational complexity, so the number of parameters in a given neural network, is presented. Since none of the compared articles provided this parameter, there is provided algorithm by which these values could be calculated for each analyzed model.

abstract = {Swarm intelligence is a a branch of artificial intelligence grounded in the observation that swarms of simple individuals or agents with very limited intelligence can achieve remarkably intricate collective behaviors through decentralized low-level interactions among themselves and with environment. An illustrative manifestation of this concept is found in swarm robotics, wherein highly sophisticated robots are replaced by a swarm of simple and cost-effective micro-robots. In a prior study, the authors introduced Proteus II, a versatile and economical robotic unit tailored for swarm robotics applications. In this paper, we leverage a swarm of Proteus II units to tackle a navigation and marker detection and identification mission. Each robotic unit is tasked with traversing the environment to find the location of an individually-assigned graphical marker. To surmount this challenge, we adopt a hybrid approach combining swarm intelligence and computer vision techniques. We conduct a series of experiments encompassing both physical and virtual robotic units to evaluate the efficacy of our methodology. Our findings demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed approach. In light of these results, we posit that our approach holds significant promise for advancing the field of swarm robotics. By harnessing the collective capabilities of simple robotic units, we pave the way for a multitude of future endeavors in this domain.},

abstract = {Collaboration analytics has the potential to empower teachers and students with valuable insights to facilitate more meaningful and engaging collaborative learning experiences. Towards this end, we developed computational models of student speech during small group work, identifying instances of uplifting behavior related to three Community Agreements: community building, moving thinking forward, and being respectful. Pre-trained RoBERTa language models were fine-tuned and evaluated on human annotated data (N = 9,607 student utterances from 100 unique 5-minute classroom recordings). The models achieved moderate accuracies (AUROCs between 0.67-0.84) and were robust to speech recognition errors. Preliminary generalizability studies indicated that the models generalized well to two other domains (transfer ratios between 0.46-0.85; with 1.0 indicating perfect transfer). We also developed four approaches to provide qualitative feedback in the form of noticings (i.e., specific exemplars) of positive instances of the Community Agreements, finding moderate alignment with human ratings. This research contributes to the computational modeling of the relationship dimension of collaboration from noisy classroom data, selection of positive examples for qualitative feedback, and towards the empowerment of teachers to support diverse learners during collaborative learning.},

MicroCode addresses this by enabling portable programming directly on the micro:bit using a battery-powered accessory with an OLED screen and navigation buttons. This system utilises a simple, handheld graphical tile-based programming paradigm, yet supports complex programs with features including conditional execution and variables, providing immediate feedback through live programming. This paper illustrates how early studies have received a positive reception from children and educators, especially when paired with robotics as an application domain. Plans for future work aim to extend the reach of Microcode by providing more tangible digital learning opportunities to pre-literate children and communities around the world where access to mains power and internet are scarce.},

abstract = {Traditional grading practices have been criticized for their lack of accuracy and fairness in assessing student learning by using a one-size-fits-all approach that does not account for differences in students' backgrounds, experiences, or learning needs. This study examines the use of a hybrid of competency- and equity-based grading style across the computer science curriculum. Specifically, this study explores the experiences of students and educators in implementing this grading system and assesses its initial impact on student success and attitudes toward learning through observational data. Data was collected over fall, spring, and summer terms that included in-person and remote instruction. The courses studied range from an introductory course to upper-level courses (both required and elective). We discuss the commonly brought-up issue of feasibility and its impact on faculty and students that are already tasked with many responsibilities by reviewing the number of student interactions that took place outside of scheduled class time. We see that the amount of time required to assess the students does increase slightly compared to traditional assessment but the number of student interactions increases, thus leading to more engagement. By examining and refining this approach to assessment and grading, we contribute to a deeper understanding of how competency- and equity-based grading can support more equitable and inclusive educational practices that help students achieve a high level of content understanding.},

abstract = {Separation logic’s compositionality and local reasoning properties have led to significant advances in scalable static analysis. But program analysis has new challenges—many programs display computational effects and, orthogonally, static analyzers must handle incorrectness too. We present Outcome Separation Logic (OSL), a program logic that is sound for both correctness and incorrectness reasoning in programs with varying effects. OSL has a frame rule—just like separation logic—but uses different underlying assumptions that open up local reasoning to a larger class of properties than can be handled by any single existing logic. Building on this foundational theory, we also define symbolic execution algorithms that use bi-abduction to derive specifications for programs with effects. This involves a new tri-abduction procedure to analyze programs whose execution branches due to effects such as nondeterministic or probabilistic choice. This work furthers the compositionality promised by separation logic by opening up the possibility for greater reuse of analysis tools across two dimensions: bug-finding vs verification in programs with varying effects.},

abstract = {K-12 computing education research is a rapidly growing field of research, both driven by and driving the implementation of computing as a school and extra-curricular subject globally. Within discipline-based education research, it is a new and emerging field, drawing on fields such as mathematics and science education research for inspiration and theoretical bases. The urgency around investigating effective teaching and learning in computing in school alongside broadening participation has led to much of the field being focused on empirical research. Less attention has been paid to the underlying philosophical assumptions informing the discipline, which might include a critical examination of the rationale for K-12 computing education, its goals and perspectives, and associated inherent values and beliefs. The goals of this research project are to understand the implicit and hidden values, perspectives and goals underpinning computing education at school. This will be achieved through a critical examination of a wide body of literature leading to the development of a categorization and framework.},

We found that teachers needed to view student code remotely, student code auto-save, differentiation of student assignments, and a tutorial library for students to learn about the programming environment. In addition to rating feature usefulness, we also asked teachers to list features or needs that the survey did not address. Through qualitative responses, we found that teachers wanted cheating prevention and detection, the ability to freeze and project code onto student screens, and student and classroom-level analytics. We also compare the needs of teachers who teach computing as the main subject in their classroom to the needs of teachers who integrate computing into another discipline. This research can inform the development of programming learning systems to better support teachers and their students.},

abstract = {Nowadays, educators face the challenge of students developing their own work and acquiring problem-solving skills, especially with the widespread use of AI tools. This includes issues like excessive dependence on AI, creativity stagnation, and prioritizing comprehension over rote learning, all while navigating ethical concerns in academic submissions. Higher education in computer science encounters difficulties as traditional methods become less relevant for new generations (e.g., early college students taking dual enrollment courses) and emerging computer science programs such as CS + X, data science/analytics, and cybersecurity. Some computer science programs integrate labs into lectures, while others keep them as a separate course component. The modalities and resources in higher education vary, including teacher assistance, Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) with tutors, and more, e.g., see: [4]. In addition, some nations find themselves in the position of needing to provide professional development for new computer science teachers. These educators may not have a background in computer science but instead, come from fields related to education or STEM. They require training to effectively teach the material or, at the very least, a guide on what to teach. To address this, there is a need for a guided inquiry learning tool to help disseminate course material. The workbook tool we introduce is designed for the first year on computer science courses such as CS 1 and CS 2, allowing students to work independently or in teams guided by multimedia access through a QR code. Each activity is structured to align with the topics outlined in the CS2023 knowledge areas while also incorporating Bloom's for Computing verbs.},

The Navajo are one of the country's largest NA groups, and understanding the barriers and developing solutions to increase their participation will have far-reaching consequences on informing the research and practice on how computing can be taught at NA-serving high schools. The paper describes the experience gained over three years of working in this region via project Let's Talk Code, which aims to help math, science, and art teachers from Navajo high schools develop CS-based projects in their existing courses and provide mentorship and guidance. Let's Talk Code is constructed as a research-practice partnership (RPP) where the teachers (practitioners) work with a multi-institutional team of researchers and CS educators to improve the capacity-building needs of its partners (high schools). The paper details the evolution of the project over the years and highlights challenges, barriers, and strategies that were used to impact a significant number of teachers throughout the project.},

Consequently, AI literacy is becoming an essential component of modern education. AI, however, is both an unfamiliar topic and a moving target due to fast development. Determining what non-experts need to know about AI is therefore not straightforward, and the answer varies based on the educational context and level. This keynote begins by exploring the challenges of introducing AI literacy in K-12 education, drawing on insights from previous computing-related K-12 curricular reforms. It then presents a four-stage process of co-creating AI lesson plans with students, teachers, and teacher trainers in Finland. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned and future ideas for AI in K-12 education.},

The Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSES) was utilized for the online survey. The students were selected through purposive sampling. The grades of the students in fundamentals and intermediate programming in C language were also collected. The data was preprocessed to ensure quality. The data was analyzed using Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis using RStudio and Google Colaboratory. The result highlights that intermediate programming grade in C has no significant influence to predict OOP performance in Java, but the grade in fundamentals of programming in C language and self-efficacy using CPSES are good contributing factors to the prediction model. The result of this study offers educators a powerful tool for curriculum development and pedagogical strategies to better help students and future research studies in this domain.},

Hence, there is a need for providing easier methods for people and organizations to access, analyze, and interpret reliable, publicly available data (e.g., U.S. Census), and create data narratives that reflect their social position in the society and inform how to improve that position. In this case study, we document our journey on using computational notebooks to increase autonomy for organizations tackling racial and social justice issues by making meaningful use of publicly available data. The project considered a participatory action research approach run in partnership with a non-profit organization supporting Black engineers. The reported case study involved participants representing staff and volunteer leadership of the organization. We expect that the presented reflections help move towards a more equitable way of performing data analysis while using popular and freely available technologies.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches.

abstract = {As cyberthreats become more commonplace, the teaching of cybersecurity concepts at an introductory level is becoming increasingly important. However, teaching this subject in an engaging manner is challenging. This work investigates the use of a game-based learning approach to teaching cybersecurity concepts in the form of a card game called Program Wars. Within the game, players use cards to create a representation of a computer program while launching cyberattacks at their opponents and defending their own program. As the initial version of the game presented cybersecurity concepts at only a high-level, Program Wars&nbsp;v.2.0&nbsp;was created to introduce players to eight common cyberattacks and the tools used to defend against them. The results of a user study show that after playing Program Wars&nbsp;v.2.0&nbsp;a player’s knowledge of cybersecurity concepts is improved, showing that our game-based learning approach provides an effective means for introducing cybersecurity concepts to those with little or no prior knowledge. As Program Wars&nbsp;is a freely available web-based game, it can easily be integrated into classes to improve a student’s knowledge of cybersecurity concepts.},

These outcomes are usually publicized on course syllabi, websites, labs, projects, and other assignments. Faculty often assess learning outcomes on specific assignments, exam questions, and projects. This paper presents an assignment in which students document the skills and knowledge they developed in a course through several revisions of a r\'{e}sum\'{e}. The purpose of this assignment is not to assess learning outcomes directly, but to see how students characterized their experiences in the course. Even though students were not explicitly asked to include skills tied to course learning outcomes, all course learning outcomes appeared on at least one student's r\'{e}sum\'{e}. The learning outcomes that were more general (implementing/extending solutions, tracing/executing algorithms, teamwork/collaboration) appeared often on students' r\'{e}sum\'{e}s. In addition to r\'{e}sum\'{e} revisions, the assignment required students to apply to at least one job, internship, or summer research experience. The r\'{e}sum\'{e}s helped the instructor learn about students' backgrounds, goals, and interests and could advise them toward more specific internships and job opportunities throughout the semester. The assignment also showed the instructor what made it into the r\'{e}sum\'{e}, which were likely the course experiences that students valued the most.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant interest across various domains due to their efficacy in learning from graph-structured data. In pursuit of heightened performance, numerous GNN frameworks have emerged recently. However, recent work tends to study performance optimization at the computational graph level and operator level separately, and the existing optimization techniques rely on pattern matching and manual intervention, driven by human expertise. Consequently, their performances remain sub-optimal and sensitive to input graphs and GNN models. In this work, we develop an efficient coordinated strategy named AlphaGNN, which achieves an effective combination of computational graph optimization and operator optimization. To render this coordinated optimization impactful, a rule-based computational graph optimization and a performance-driven operator optimization are proposed. The experimental results confirm that AlphaGNN achieves up to 12.39 \texttimes{} (2.94 \texttimes{} on average) performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods on diverse GNN models.},

abstract = {We propose an assistive technology that helps individuals with Color Vision Deficiencies (CVD) to recognize/name colors. A dichromat’s color perception is a reduced two-dimensional (2D) subset of a normal trichromat’s three dimensional color (3D) perception, leading to confusion when visual stimuli that appear identical to the dichromat are referred to by different color names. Using our proposed system, CVD individuals can interactively induce distinct perceptual changes to originally confusing colors via a computational color space transformation. By combining their original 2D precepts for colors with the discriminative changes, a three dimensional color space is reconstructed, where the dichromat can learn to resolve color name confusions and accurately recognize colors. Our system is implemented as an Augmented Reality (AR) interface on smartphones, where users interactively control the rotation through swipe gestures and observe the induced color shifts in the camera view or in a displayed image. Through psychophysical experiments and a longitudinal user study, we demonstrate that such rotational color shifts have discriminative power (initially confusing colors become distinct under rotation) and exhibit structured perceptual shifts dichromats can learn with modest training. The AR App is also evaluated in two real-world scenarios (building with lego blocks and interpreting artistic works); users all report positive experience in using the App to recognize object colors that they otherwise could not.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of social media among ever younger children, there is a growing need to educate young learners about the key concepts and mechanisms related to data collection, profiling, and content recommendation on online platforms. This paper presents a gamified K–9 classroom activity where learners analyze data traces to construct and iteratively refine detailed profiles of a mystery online person, thereby learning to recognize the digital traces typical of online interactions. Using data from 163 fifth- and eighth-grade students collected over 11 game sessions, the results demonstrate that the majority of learners were able to analyze and integrate various data traces to assemble coherent profiles, showing an emerging competence in recognizing data collection and profiling in online interactions, including their ubiquity, multimodality, and their consequences. The results also reveal that the learners’ ability to critically reflect on profiling is still developing. This paper contributes to the fields of AI education and social media literacy by demonstrating the feasibility of early education on social media mechanisms.},

abstract = {Border Theory suggests individuals create borders to manage the transitions between work and family (or, more generally, life) domains. The degree of separation or integration of domains across borders has an impact on the balance between work and life. Previous studies have shown individuals who perceive balance between work and life domains tend to be more satisfied with their lives, reporting higher physical and mental health. At times of crisis, such as during a pandemic, borders can be disrupted, affecting work-life balance and leading to a short- or long-term negative impact on well-being. Border theory provides a systematic lens through which to study these changes. However, changes cannot be studied using interviews or diaries as these are not at the scale required when societal disruptions occur. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a computational linguistic approach to operationalize border theory at scale, using readily available social media data. In particular, we make two main contributions. First, we design metrics to measure key characteristics of borders. This involves the application of a transformer-based topic modeling technique, BERTopic, to detect topics from social media data. Second, we apply this operationalization to a case study of around a million tweets posted by nearly two hundred teachers and journalists in the UK from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2022. In so doing, we longitudinally study and compare the changes in borders between work and life before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown periods.},

The study utilizes a sample of 34 subjects whose eye movements are recorded by a Tobii Pro Spectrum 600 Hz. The results show that the holistic models of image perception are suitable for application to source code. In addition, it can be observed that the code reviews are conducted in phases, which are characterized by certain strategies (e.g. scan, error detection,...). Furthermore, experience-related differences can be detected between experts and novices, which emphasize that experts use elaborate strategies and have a comparatively better ability to collect and process information from source code.},

abstract = {With the increasing interest and enrollment in programming courses, educators must discover innovative and inclusive teaching methods to effectively cater to diverse learner needs and varying levels of prior knowledge. Introductory programming courses (CS1) can prove arduous for novices and insufficiently stimulating for those with experience, creating an educational dilemma. Striking a balance between students' expectations and engagement becomes challenging for educators, especially given the expanding pre-higher education CS exposure.To tackle this challenge, offering optional extra practice opportunities could aid students in mastering concepts, particularly those benefitting from rigorous practice. However, personal motivation and other factors may hinder their engagement, undermining potential benefits. To enhance engagement, providing a minor amount of extra credit as an extrinsic incentive might be effective.In this context, students' engagement with extra credit quizzes (ECQs) is influenced by various factors, with self-regulation and time management playing a pivotal role. This study delves into the correlation between students' weekly ECQ submission time and their total quiz interactions. Specifically, it examines whether the timing of weekly ECQ submissions varies based on the number of quizzes engaged. The analysis also explores group discrepancies in submission times, considering factors like gender and prior programming experience (PPE) relative to ECQ engagement. Ultimately, these insights could reshape educational approaches to better address student needs.},

abstract = {Feedback has the power to support students' development as agentive writers or to reinforce the authority of the teacher. The degree to which feedback is power-affirming---legitimizing students' ideas and positioning students as authors in the writing process---is a critical yet challenging construct to implement and measure. As teachers increasingly adopt AI-powered feedback solutions, it is important to understand how such feedback positions students. In this work, we collect a dataset of 1,012 in-line feedback comments on 7-10th grade student essays by 20 experienced English Language Arts (ELA) teachers, along with 400 in-line comments by GPT3. We adapt a framework of power-affirming feedback to annotate and characterize this data, and we train RoBERTa-based models to automatically classify feedback comments along key dimensions of the framework. We find that teacher-written comments are significantly more power-affirming than AI comments and that power-affirming feedback occurs infrequently in both teacher-written and AI-generated feedback. Our results indicate that RoBERTa-based models can effectively measure dimensions of power-affirming feedback, indicating that computational measures can serve as a scalable method for identifying and facilitating power-affirming feedback.},

abstract = {Model curricula for baccalaureate computer science (CS) have been published regularly from 1968 through 2013. In early 2021, the ACM, IEEE-Computer Society, and the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) constituted a task force to revise these curricula, which have now been released as Computer Science 2023 Curricula (CS2023). The CS2023 curricular guidelines inform educators and administrators on the what, why, and how to cover undergraduate CS over the next decade. Like past guidelines, CS2023 provides curricular content - a knowledge model largely backward compatible with CS2013, supplemented by a competency framework influenced by Computing Curricula 2020 (CC2020) - and complementary curricular practices, which include articles by international experts on program design and delivery. Ongoing drafts of CS2023 were disseminated via the CS2023 website, along with regular publications or presentations at various computing education venues.This panel focuses on three among the 17 CS2023 knowledge areas: Society, Ethics, and the Profession (SEP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Security (SEC). While the other 14 knowledge areas remain important in CS education, these three have been in the news due to inadequacies in current CS education. The panelists, who served on the CS2023 steering committee, will discuss how CS2023 addresses these challenges. Attendees will appreciate the approach taken by CS2023 toward these three hot-button items of CS education, especially constraints on curriculum design, and how CS2023 may be used to educate the next generation of CS graduates to rise to these three challenges.},

To assist human experts in their efforts, several projects are proposing computational methods that aim at supporting the detection of malicious content online. In the first part of the lecture, we will overview the different approaches, spanning from solutions involving humans and a crowd of users to fully automated approaches. In the second part, we will focus our attention on the data driven verification for computational fact checking. We will review methods that combine solutions from the ML and NLP literature to build data driven verification, such as those that translate text claims into SQL queries on relational databases. We will also cover how the rich semantics in knowledge graphs and pre-trained language models can be used to verify claims and produce explanations, which is a key requirement in this space. Better access to data and new algorithms are pushing computational fact checking forward, with experimental results showing that verification methods enable effective labeling of claims, both in simulations and in real world efforts. However, while fact checkers start to adopt some of the resulting tools, the misinformation fight is far from being won. In the last part of this lecture, we will cover the opportunities and limitations of computational methods and their role in fighting misinformation.},

This knowledge gap hinders the development of effective upskilling courses, especially as new CS curricula are being introduced worldwide. This study investigates new CS teachers’ conceptions of fundamental Internet principles, compares them with children’s understanding, and examines the relationship between teachers’ Internet knowledge and their knowledge of basic digital trace topics.Study Methods: A convergent mixed-methods approach was used, involving semi-structured interviews and drawing tasks with 50 new CS teachers. Data from a separate sample of 165 children (Grades 4, 6, 8) were included for comparison. A thematic analysis and frequency analysis of interview transcripts were conducted.Findings: Most new CS teachers recognized the Internet as a global network but had varied and often unstable conceptions about data storage and transfer. Compared to children, teachers demonstrated a more advanced understanding but still exhibited substantial knowledge gaps. There was no significant correlation between understanding Internet principles and basic digital trace topics, though a moderate relationship was found regarding news feed personalization.Conclusions: The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve new CS teachers’ understanding of Internet principles, especially the invisible aspects, such as data storage and transfer mechanisms. By providing new data on a rarely studied group, this study contributes to both CS education and broader fields like developmental psychology and conceptual change, offering insights into the developmental trajectories of Internet comprehension and the integration of everyday and scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {Technological intervention to support care areas that some people may not have access to is of paramount importance to promote sustainable development of good health and wellbeing. This study aims to explore the linguistic similarities and differences between human professionals and Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) conversational agents in therapeutic dialogues. Initially, the MISTRAL-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is instructed to generate responses to patient queries to form a synthetic equivalent to a publicly available psychology dataset. A large set of linguistic features (e.g., text metrics, lexical diversity and richness, readability scores, sentiment, emotions, and named entities) is extracted and studied from both the expert and synthetically-generated text. The results suggest a significantly richer vocabulary in humans than the LLM approach. Similarly, the use of sentiment was significantly different between the two, suggesting a difference in the supportive or objective language used and that synthetic linguistic expressions of emotion may differ from those expressed by an intelligent being. However, no statistical significance was observed between human professionals and AI in the use of function words, pronouns and several named entities; possibly reflecting an increased proficiency of LLMs in modelling some language patterns, even in a specialised context (i.e., therapy). However, current findings do not support the similarity in sentimental nuance and emotional expression, which limits the effectiveness of contemporary LLMs as standalone agents. Further development is needed towards clinically validated algorithms.},

This methodological practice is reasonable if participants' responses are stable over time such that, all other relevant factors being held constant, their responses today will be the same as their responses to the same questions at a later time. However, we do not know how often that is the case. It is possible that participants' true moral preferences change, are subject to temporary moods or whims, or are influenced by environmental factors we don't track. If participants' moral responses are unstable in such ways, it would raise important methodological and theoretical issues for how participants' true moral preferences, opinions, and judgments can be ascertained. We address this possibility here by asking the same survey participants the same moral questions about which patient should receive a kidney when only one is available ten times in ten different sessions over two weeks, varying only presentation order across sessions. We measured how often participants gave different responses to simple (Study One) and more complicated (Study Two) controversial and uncontroversial repeated scenarios. On average, the fraction of times participants changed their responses to controversial scenarios (i.e., indicating instability) was around 10-18% (± 14--15%) across studies, and this instability is observed to have positive associations with response time and decision-making difficulty. We discuss the implications of these results for the efficacy of common moral preference elicitation methods, highlighting the role of response instability in potentially causing value misalignment between the stakeholders and AI tools trained on their moral judgments.},

abstract = {Efficient and accurate simulations of pedestrian dynamics are critical for the smart cities of the future. In this work, we present a computational toolbox that accelerates such simulations relative to a popularly used pedestrian simulation tool by leveraging computational frameworks initially developed for molecular simulation. We make the argument that the field of pedestrian dynamics could benefit to a significant extent from a serendipitous interdisciplinary synergy with the molecular-simulation community. We provide arguments and representative examples in support of this premise, demonstrating that molecular simulation tools can be repurposed to solve precisely the same governing equations as traditional pedestrian-dynamics simulation tools, yielding the same results in significantly reduced computational time. We also describe a computational tool that we have developed that streamlines the conversion of indoor maps into boundary conditions for pedestrian simulations.},

year = {2025},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {The language used by US courtroom actors in criminal trials has long been studied for biases. However, systematic studies for bias in high-stakes court trials have been difficult, due to the nuanced nature of bias and the legal expertise required. Large language models offer the possibility to automate annotation. But validating the computational approach requires both an understanding of how automated methods fit in existing annotation workflows and what they really offer. We present a case study of adding a computational model to a complex and high-stakes problem: identifying gender-biased language in US capital trials for women defendants. Our team of experienced death-penalty lawyers and NLP technologists pursue a three-phase study: first annotating manually, then training and evaluating computational models, and finally comparing expert annotations to model predictions. Unlike many typical NLP tasks, annotating for gender bias in months-long capital trials is complicated, with many individual judgment calls. Contrary to standard arguments for automation that are based on efficiency and scalability, legal experts find the computational models most useful in providing opportunities to reflect on their own bias in annotation and to build consensus on annotation rules. This experience suggests that seeking to replace experts with computational models for complex annotation is both unrealistic and undesirable. Rather, computational models offer valuable opportunities to assist the legal experts in annotation-based studies.},

abstract = {There are many advantages to an integrated approach to computer science, which applies computing concepts and practices within disciplines other than computer science (CS). Not only is it a compelling approach to attracting students who would otherwise be uninterested or unable to access CS instruction, but all disciplines have challenges that could use computational tools and methods; thus, an integrated computing approach develops computational literacy in all students [1]. This integrated approach is being increasingly used in elementary settings; however, students with disabilities continue to be left out of these initiatives [2]. This experience report describes how our team used recommendations from the literature to develop an integrated computing curriculum for elementary students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) that combines coding with social skills instruction using DASH robots. Social skills are pivotal for all students, particularly those with ASD, as they learn to problem solve and use critical thinking skills in group settings. We discuss how we used data collection measures to iteratively revise the curriculum and instructional experience. We conclude by previewing our project's next steps and discussing lessons learned from the development process, such as the need for ready-to-use materials with built-in opportunities for differentiation and the need for professional learning communities to support teachers implementing the curriculum.},

abstract = {The celebrated Asynchronous Computability Theorem of Herlihy and Shavit (JACM 1999) provided a topological characterization of the tasks that are wait-free solvable by processes communicating through writing and reading shared registers. This characterization assumes the use of full-information protocols, in which each time a process writes in the shared memory, it communicates everything it learned since the beginning of the execution. Thus, each register in the shared memory is of unbounded size. Whether unbounded size registers are unavoidable for the model of computation to be universal is the central question studied in this paper. More generally, when at most t out of n processes can crash, is the model with bounded size registers universal?We show that when 1 ≤ t &lt; n/2 registers of size O(t) bits are sufficient to solve any task that is solvable by a full-information protocol. The situation is radically different when n/2 &lt; t &lt; n, which includes the wait-free case. We show that bounded registers are not universal. Specifically, we show that, for any bound f: ℕ → ℕ, and for any n &gt; 2, there exists a task that cannot be solved by n processes communicating via registers of size f(n) bits, but is solvable by n processes using unbounded registers. The case n = 2, t = 1, where 1-resilient computing and wait-free computing coincide, does not display the same behavior. We show that any task solvable by 2 processes in the wait-free shared-memory model with unbounded-size registers can be solved by 2 processes in the wait-free shared-memory model with constant size registers.Finally, we consider the iterated shared memory model, which has played a crucial role since Herlihy and Shavit's characterization. We show that 1-bit registers (per iteration) are sufficient for solving wait-free any task that is solvable by a full-information wait-free protocol. Therefore, while the wait-free read/write shared-memory model is known to be computationally equivalent to the iterated model, this equivalence only holds if registers are unbounded.},

abstract = {In recent years, blended teaching mode has been widely used in colleges and universities, and student learning engagement has become one of the most important indicators for assessing the effects of educational policies and reforms, making the study of learning engagement a hot topic and trend. This study aims to understand the current situation of students' learning engagement, explore the main factors affecting blended teaching, and put forward suggestions for teaching practice. The study used questionnaires and systematic analyses, and the results found that: the overall blended learning engagement level of college students is in the middle of the range, in which the emotional engagement is the highest, while the communication and interaction engagement is the lowest. In addition, the input level of female students is significantly higher than that of male students, and there are significant differences in behavioural input and communication and interaction input. The degree of influence of each influencing factor of blended learning input on the overall learning input, in descending order, is the individual factor, environmental factor, peer factor, and teacher factor. In the dimensions of behavioural input, cognitive input and affective input, individual factors and peer factors have a significant positive effect on input, and in the dimension of communicative-interactive input, individual factors, peer factors, teacher factors and environmental factors all have a significant positive effect on communicative-interactive input. Based on this, the article concludes with recommendations for improvement: stimulating students' motivation and confidence in learning, strengthening hardware equipment and technical support, and developing collaborative and participatory learning styles to promote effective learning and cultivate innovative thinking.},

This paper delves into the integration of social cognition in AI, tracing back to its historical foundations and examining seminal theories like Newell’s Bands of Cognition, Minsky’s Society of Mind, etc., which have emphasized the importance of social cognition since AI’s inception. We highlight the shortcomings of traditional computational theory of mind approaches, particularly in their failure to capture the embodied nature of social cognition. Advocating for including embodied socio-cognitive perspectives, we draw on theories such as Participatory Sensemaking and frameworks like Observable Creative Sensemaking. The paper further demonstrates the practical implementation of these concepts in AI through two case studies: one in co-creative dance AI and another in text-to-image generative AI systems.},

We explore whether preferences and program implementation differ between genders within a story, game and visual adventure in Hedy, a gradual textual programming language. We analysed 14,233 programs within five Hedy levels created by 2,819 users who turned 10 to 14 in 2023. We found that boys, girls and nonbinary children worked most on the game adventure. Within the individual adventures, gender differences occur in all three adventures in the most elaborate Hedy level analysed. However, for some levels, no gender differences were found. Thus, programming assignments can be created in which children of different genders work on similar programs in terms of size and number of (unique) commands used.},

abstract = {In today's rapidly changing technological landscape, it is becoming increasingly evident that solar weather, simulations, and artificial intelligence (AI) are topics that can be and should be integrated into middle school education. Solar weather events can create massive problems with climate, communication, and technology, problems that can be alleviated by prediction. These events generate massive amounts of data that AI can use for such prediction. These topics can be introduced through simulations. How can we integrate solar weather data and simulations with AI-driven models to create interactive and educational software? This paper reviews lessons and pedagogical approaches used to teach about solar weather, AI and incorporate simulations to integrate CS concepts into other middle school subject areas. The research supports year one of a three-year project. The length of the project allows time to develop a progression to introduce CS concepts and the development of a simulation that can be used in a variety of middle school classrooms.},

Though algorithm visualizations and visual programming may be helpful, such tools need to offer sufficiently expressive environments that support active, constructivist learning via exploration and experimentation. In this study, we investigated whether Algot, a visual programming language that relies on a novel programming-by-demonstration paradigm, is effective for teaching recursion to 14-17 year old students, and whether it compares favorably to the popular visual programming language Scratch. We conducted an experimental study with 23 participants where they learned recursion in a video tutorial using Algot and Scratch, worked out code exercises in each respective language, and then solved a post-test on recursion. Despite the participants being more familiar with Scratch than Algot, our results indicated that students instructed with Algot demonstrated a significantly better understanding of recursion (Bayes Factor = 14.09, p = 0.005, Cohen's d = 1.30). We also found that students reported a similar level of enjoyment of each language. These findings provide preliminary evidence about the effectiveness of the programming-by-demonstration paradigm, as implemented in Algot, in aiding the comprehension of complex programming concepts like recursion.},

This research is informed by an open-call survey, completed by 22 individuals, and semi-structured interviews with 33 professionals, including archivists, librarians, digital humanists, literary scholars, historians, and computer scientists. Drawing on these results, this article offers an analysis of user experiences of computational research methods applied to digitised and born-digital archives. With a focus on humanities and social science researchers, this article also discusses users who resist this kind of research, perhaps because they lack the skills necessary to engage with these materials at scale, or because they prefer to use more traditional methods, such as close reading and historical analysis. Here, we explore the uses of computational and more “traditional” research methodologies applied to digital records. We also make a series of recommendations to elevate users’ computational skills but also to improve the digital infrastructure to make archives more accessible and usable.},

abstract = {An understanding of the molecular basis of musculoskeletal pain is necessary for the development of therapeutics, their management, and possible personalization. One-in-three Americans use OTC pain killers, and one tenth use prescription drugs to manage pain. The CDC also estimates that about 20% Americans suffer from chronic pain. As the experience of acute or chronic pain varies due to individual genetics and physiology, it is imperative that researchers continue to find novel therapeutics to treat or manage symptoms. In this paper, our goal is to develop a seed knowledgebase computational platform, called BioNursery, that will allow biologists to computationally hypothesize, define and test molecular mechanisms underlying pain. In our knowledge ecosystem, we accumulate curated information from users about the relationships among biological databases, analysis tools, and database contents to generate biological analyses modules, called π-graphs, or process graphs. We propose a mapping function from a natural language description of a hypothesized molecular model to a computational workflow for testing in BioNursery. We use a crowd computing feedback and curation system, called Explorer, to improve proposed computational models for molecular mechanism discovery, and growing the knowledge ecosystem. Since the pain knowledge ecosystem does not yet exist, we validate our approach over a similar application in fertility research.},

abstract = {The innovation and progress in technology have brought about changes in the approach to education at universities, leading to the emergence of blended learning models. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in Vietnam during 2020-2021 has accelerated the adoption of blended learning in some educational institutions, with FPT education system being at the forefront, including FPT University, FPT Polytechnic College, FPT BTEC College, and others. In this study, the authors adopt the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) proposed by [7] and the SERVQUAL model derived from the research conducted by [25] to propose a research model analyzing the factors influencing students' satisfaction with the blended learning method. The research surveyed 264 students at FPT educational institutions who participated in classes using the blended teaching method. Quantitative research methods, including reliability testing of measurement scales, exploratory factor analysis, and linear regression models, were employed. The results identified that three out of four factors have an impact on student satisfaction with the blended learning method, including: (1) Perceived usefulness, (2) Interaction, (3) Learning Environment. Additionally, some suggested solutions are proposed to help FPT educational institutions effectively implement blended learning, thereby enhancing student satisfaction with this approach in the future},

abstract = {As programming skills become more demanded in fields outside of computer science, we need to consider how we should be teaching these skills to our students. One option is to encourage students to pursue introductory computer science courses; however, these courses are often geared towards computer science (CS) majors and without important discipline-specific context. Other avenues include short coding modules within disciplinary courses or full courses that blend CS with another discipline. Guided by insights from an introductory CS course in the context of biology, we describe a key tension when coding meets biology: while contextualized programming classes are often perceived as more accessible, students may also view them as less authentic. Taken together, these observations point to specific recommendations for educators who choose to integrate coding and biology in this way. Ultimately, we conclude that discipline-specific programming education is essential to improve equity in computing education.},

abstract = {All students benefit when computer science (CS) materials are accessible, but it is critical for students with disabilities. In order to provide opportunities for all students to be successful, it is important for teachers to be able to evaluate the accessibility of their lessons and technology. One way to evaluate accessibility is the POUR framework. The POUR framework represents what can be Perceived through the senses, how users can Operate a material or technology, how it is Understandable to users, and the overall Robustness. POUR provides a promising way for K-12 CS teachers to evaluate accessibility for their learners. We describe how the POUR framework was used by a cohort of teachers to evaluate VEX 123 for their learners with disabilities. Findings from the teacher POUR analysis revealed that overall, the teachers noted that the VEX 123 provided the necessary range of entryways into coding through its three modalities: The touch coding on the robot itself, the coder cards, and VECcode (the block-based coding environment). At the same time, the teachers indicated that some students with disabilities faced a number of motor and sensory difficulties. Overall, this study showcased a way for teachers to provide insight into the level of accessibility of CS education tools specific to their students' strengths and needs.},

abstract = {Objectives. At the K–12 level, “CS for All” initiatives across the country strive to increase equitable access to and participation in computer science (CS). However, there are many open questions about the implementation and effectiveness of these initiatives, including the extent to which exposing young people to CS early on can shape their longer-term CS interest and engagement. In this article, we examine CS participation among 6th–8th-grade Black girls and assess whether CS participation during middle school shapes CS interest and engagement during their first year of high school. We focus on Black girls in the hopes of developing a more nuanced and rigorous understanding of computing experiences at the intersection of racism and sexism in this field.Participants. The focal group of students in this study are 6th–8th-grade Black girls from New York City. We employ a comparative lens in this article, contextualizing the CS experiences and outcomes of Black girls to Latinas, Asian, and White girls, as well as Black boys.Study Method. We primarily rely on quantitative data for this article, applying a critical lens to our analyses and interpretation. More specifically, we conduct descriptive analyses of course-taking patterns as well as survey data that focus on student attitudes and beliefs about CS. We then carry out inferential analyses of students’ administrative records examining how, if at all, middle school CS participation is related to high school outcomes for Black girls. We employ a comparative lens and rely on qualitative data to make sense of our results.Findings. We find that, troublingly, Black girls in the district are disproportionately less likely to receive CS instruction in middle school. Black girls are also less likely than Black boys, Latinas, and White girls to feel that they belong in CS. However, Black girls in CS courses report similar levels of engagement, family, and peer support, as well as value for CS relative to other students in the district. Finally, we find that participation in CS courses in middle school does not increase the likelihood that Black girls will select high schools that offer CS courses or take a CS course during their first year of high school.Conclusions. Our findings suggest that to increase equitable access and participation in CS, it is not enough to simply expose students to CS coursework. We call for sustained attention to the experiences that Black girls have in their CS classes as well as broader structural barriers that might shape CS course-taking.},

abstract = {Extending computer science (CS) education to address inclusion, diversity, and equity in all settings can broaden the participation of underrepresented groups including the adult education. Recently, studies have examined CS education at elementary and college levels, however, little is known in the context of adult education. This study systematically investigates past studies on computing education research in adult education (formal or informal) through the lenses of a literature review. The study sought to understand: (i) how research in this domain has evolved over the years; and (ii) what impact - in terms of learning outcomes - has been reported in the literature. Data were collected from three databases including the ACM digital library, Scopus, and Web of Science. Findings from this study show that despite CS in adult education had started since the 1980s, there is little scholarly progress and advancement witnessed in this domain. In addition, indicators measuring the impact of broadening participation in CS education among adults appear insignificant. Further, the learning outcomes reported in CS education research for adults includes motivation, increased interest, self-confidence, and computing knowledge. This study revealed several gaps and draws scholar's attention to broadening participation in Adults' CS education, highlighted study implications and future research agenda.},

The model was applied to the “Sensors” course, which promoted students’ deep understanding of sensors through context creation, task-driven and AI tools. This study employed a control group and an experimental group, utilizing an AI-driven intelligent data analysis platform to analyze classroom audio and video, to assess the impact of the new teaching model on classroom atmosphere, teachers’ attention, and teacher-student intimacy. The results showed that the new teaching model effectively stimulated students’ desire for inquiry and innovative thinking, despite challenges in student adaptation and human-computer interaction. This study suggests that teachers should design adaptive strategies to balance technology use with interpersonal interactions to ensure that the change in teaching models does not diminish teacher-student intimacy.},

Through a series of skills labs, a term-long group project, and regular self-evaluation milestones, students both build their confidence and motivation to learn programming, as well as typical introductory programming skills. Key to the course's success is the integration of project-based learning with a self-evaluation approach to ungrading. In this paper, I present the design of the course, the underlying pedagogical approach leading to course design decisions, and offer resources for adopting this approach in similar CS1 courses. The paper closes with discussion reflecting on the experiences observed throughout teaching this course, and suggests that the approach of blending ungrading with project-based learning shows promise as an inherently flexible course design that supports student wellbeing, confidence, and motivation.},

For this study, we analyzed research papers in order to better understand the landscape of CE research as it relates to students with disabilities. Of the 771 papers reviewed from 12 major CE venues over the last decade, very few (n = 14) specify student participants' disability status; this &lt;3% rate is under-representative, given that about 15% of students in the US have a disability. Studies that do specify disability status tend to involve students who are in the middle grades, in the United States, and/or are participating in elective activities. Demographic factors (e.g., gender and race) are specified about half of the time and analyzed about half as often as they are specified. A small cadre of researchers (51 from 22 different institutions) are responsible for the studies specifying disability status. Studies - whether they specify disability status or not - most commonly use block-based programming, which may present accessibility issues for some students. Advancing equity for all students will necessitate much more research on the computing experiences of students with disabilities, including reporting factors such as demographic data that make it easier to determine whether and how the research applies in a given context. More research focused on accessible tools and languages for learning computing is also needed to further understand promising practices for teaching students with disabilities.},

Although previous efforts have highlighted the advantages of engaging young children in PD, research has overlooked their involvement as co-designers, leading to a lack of exploration and understanding of their unique perspectives and challenges in the design process. Through an interactive session and collaborative activities, this workshop will facilitate discussions surrounding challenges, successes, and lessons learned through PD with young children. By evaluating and exchanging experiences, we aim to enhance our understanding of PD and refine its methodologies for this particular population. By synthesizing the shortcomings, difficulties, and successes of past experiences, the workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to initiate efforts toward closing this research gap. Together we will establish the groundwork for enhanced approaches and a deeper understanding of how to involve young children in PD, which will enhance future efforts in the field of CCI.},

abstract = {Computer science related topics are increasingly introduced at elementary school level, aiming not only to establish basic knowledge, but also to foster affective aspects such as motivation or self-efficacy. While corrective feedback is helpful to achieve the former, it may negatively impact the latter. This raises the question on how to provide feedback in an encouraging way that makes learners feel competent but also autonomous. To shed light on this question, we conducted a robotics course with 45 children aged nine to eleven years, in which we studied their preferences when given a choice of either solving a problem themselves (with only a hint from the tutor) or being given the solution directly.We find that children like the freedom of choice and slightly prefer solving their problems themselves, which in turn is significantly correlated with a higher improvement in self-efficacy for building and programming robots. Interestingly, however, only girls exhibit a significant correlation with resulting knowledge on building, and only eleven year old children with resulting knowledge on programming. These insights allow us to provide concrete recommendations on how to give feedback and involve elementary school children and their preferences to promote both knowledge and self-efficacy.},

Traditional assessments that do exist tend to consist largely of multiple-choice questions that do not adequately measure students' programming skills or their use of the computer science practices described in the standards. This project aims to develop and iteratively refine a mixed-format assessment for middle school computer science. The first phase of this work unpacked the middle school (6-8 grade band) CS standards to develop prototype items, including live coding tasks, that would assess the learning outcomes addressed therein. In phase 2, we tested the prototype items with students through cognitive interviews to better understand their response processes and the complex problem-solving and reasoning they demonstrated while taking the assessment.},

We present Mimosa, a human-AI co-creation tool that enables amateur users to computationally generate and manipulate spatial audio effects. For a video with only monaural or stereo audio, Mimosa automatically grounds each sound source to the corresponding sounding object in the visual scene and enables users to further validate and fix errors in the location of the sounding objects. Users can also augment the spatial audio effect by flexibly manipulating the sounding source positions and creatively customizing the audio effect. The design of Mimosa exemplifies a human-AI collaboration approach that, instead of utilizing state-of-art end-to-end “black-box” ML models, uses a multistep pipeline that aligns its interpretable intermediate results with the user’s workflow. A lab user study with 15 participants demonstrates Mimosa’s usability, usefulness, expressiveness, and capability in creating immersive spatial audio effects in collaboration with users.},

abstract = {Argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a key formalism in AI research. Their semantics have been investigated in terms of principles, which define characteristic properties in order to deliver guidance for analyzing established and developing new semantics. Because of the simple structure of AFs, many desired properties hold almost trivially, at the same time hiding interesting concepts behind syntactic notions. We extend the principle-based approach to argumentation frameworks with collective attacks (SETAFs) and provide a comprehensive overview of common principles for their semantics. Our analysis shows that investigating principles based on decomposing the given SETAF (e.g. directionality or SCC-recursiveness) poses additional challenges in comparison to usual AFs. We introduce the notion of the reduct as well as the modularization principle for SETAFs which will prove beneficial for this kind of investigation. We then demonstrate how our findings can be utilized for incremental computation of extensions and show how we can use graph properties of the frameworks to speed up these algorithms.},

abstract = {Computational notebooks have become the go-to way for solving data-science problems. While they are designed to combine code and documentation, prior work shows that documentation is largely ignored by the developers because of the manual effort. Automated documentation generation can help, but existing techniques fail to capture algorithmic details and developers often end up editing the generated text to provide more explanation and sub-steps.This paper proposes a novel machine-learning pipeline, Cell2Doc, for code cell documentation in Python data science notebooks. Our approach works by identifying different logical contexts within a code cell, generating documentation for them separately, and finally combining them to arrive at the documentation for the entire code cell. Cell2Doc takes advantage of the capabilities of existing pre-trained language models and improves their efficiency for code cell documentation. We also provide a new benchmark dataset for this task, along with a data-preprocessing pipeline that can be used to create new datasets. We also investigate an appropriate input representation for this task. Our automated evaluation suggests that our best input representation improves the pre-trained model's performance by 2.5x on average. Further, Cell2Doc achieves 1.33x improvement during human evaluation in terms of correctness, informative-ness, and readability against the corresponding standalone pre-trained model.},

abstract = {ccheck, a lenient automatic grader and C style-checker, to guide students to improve their coding practices. Many computing classes rely heavily on autograders--software that automates grading and alleviates staff workload in classes with large enrollments. At best, autograders offer timely and consistent feedback to students. However, existing autograders primarily judge on functional correctness---they are generally strict and inflexible in marking beginner programming assignments. They tend not to provide feedback on programming style and structure, which instead requires delayed, tedious manual assessment. ccheck, the tool we introduce, aims to address this gap and provide more meaningful, real-time feedback with a pedagogical focus.We deploy ccheck in a class of 440 first-year computer science students. Teaching assistants employ the system for marking assistance, while students use the same system for self-evaluation prior to finalizing their submissions. Feedback was solicited through a survey of 76 students and a focus group of the teaching team. 82% of the students surveyed said that the system helped them learn good coding practices, while 75% emphasized that the feedback received from the system is meaningful and helpful. The teaching team focus group related to how they valued the automation of menial marking tasks, which enabled them to direct their time toward other meaningful feedback. Overall, we find that teaching, learning and student experiences are improved through the deployment of ccheck.},

Yet, adult children's requirements tend to be overlooked when designing technologies to foster aging in place. In this work, we use reflexive thematic analysis to study Reddit content to understand the experiences of adult caregivers and the issues that they face in supporting their parents. The pseudonymous data allowed us to explore three research questions: 1) What are the experiences of adult children as informal helpers for elderly parents? 2) How do adult children currently manage their role as informal helpers? and 3) How might digital technology facilitate communication between aging parents and adult children as informal helpers? Our findings lead to a number of design considerations for technologies that support adult children caring for parents who are aging in place, including: building common ground, establishing boundaries, addressing guilt, encouraging in-person communication, community support for adult children, and adapting to changes in role reciprocity.},

abstract = {The Latinx community is underrepresented in tech-oriented fields, which aligns with the lack of culturally relevant learning experiences in CS for Latinx youth, hindering their ability to conceptualize technology as a tool for transformation and vehicle for cultural expression. This study takes on a restorying approach at the elementary level, where 9 fourth-grade students engaged in focus group discussions over three days to generate prompts for a generative AI art. Through the lens of restorying, the prompts had students conceptualize a future with a focus on their Mexican-American heritage, local community, and technology. The study revealed that students associated their heritage with symbolic representations such as food and music, and characterized the community as a commercialized space while also emphasizing locations conducive to family-oriented activities. As a result, technology in community spaces was associated with consumerism. However, when envisioning a futuristic, transformed community, they made deeper connections between the role of technology in the community, making intricate connections between community improvements and technology-based solutions. This underscores the need for computing education to dedicate time for young learners to reflect on the role technology has on their current culture and community to make deeper connections.},

People can now use natural language (i.e., prompts) to communicate with AI to perform tasks. While people can use foundation models through chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT), chat, regardless of the capabilities of the underlying models, is not a production tool for building reusable AI services. APIs like LangChain allow for LLM-based application development but require substantial programming knowledge, thus posing a barrier. To mitigate this, we systematically review, summarise, refine and extend the concept of AI chain by incorporating the best principles and practices that have been accumulated in software engineering for decades into AI chain engineering, to systematize AI chain engineering methodology. We also develop a no-code integrated development environment, , which embodies these AI chain engineering principles and patterns naturally in the process of building AI chains, thereby improving the performance and quality of AI chains. With Prompt Sapper, AI chain engineers can compose prompt-based AI services on top of foundation models through chat-based requirement analysis and visual programming. Our user study evaluated and demonstrated the efficiency and correctness of Prompt Sapper.},

abstract = {In response to the enrollment surge that started in many CS depart- ments around 2006, the Computing Research Association published a report on "Generation CS", which named a pervasive theme in computing education: more and a greater diversity of students are seeking computing education, even if not as traditional CS ma- jors. However, our curricula and departments have stayed much the same. We still mostly prepare students for software develop- ment jobs in the technology industry, while we rarely identify the damage that same industry has caused in our democratic societies. How do we do better? How do we change to meet the needs of a changing society? What strategies should we apply? We know that large-scale change will require structural shifts, but such shifts are likely to be slow and expensive, whereas smaller, "boots on the ground" initiatives can positively impact individuals but do little to change the systems that underlie the deeper-seated problems in computing. Navigating this paradox is imperative to our success as a field. Our panel will address the big questions about how to make structural changes in computing education in order to meet the greater needs of Generation CS.},

In order to actively support the recruitment, retention, performance, and experiences of U.S. Latines, we must make sure that we are carrying out studies with this population across outreach practices, interventions, student outcomes, and testimonies. To offer a more comprehensive understanding of the existing body of work on U.S. Latines in computing, we reviewed computing education papers that either fully center around or dedicate specific analyses to U.S. Latines. We analyzed 53 papers and found the following results: most research focuses on Student Experiences and Institutional Perspectives with very few studies on Research Opportunities; the educational setting tended to be K-12 with a severe lack of community college studies; there is a low number of popular pedagogical practices studied with U.S. Latines; research has mainly focused on students, but seldom focused families despite strong Latine connections to family; there was a strong spike in studies in 2021; and the U.S. location of the studies tended to line up with the U.S. Hispanic populations, but many states are under-performing. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest future research directions to better understand, recruit, and support Latines in computing.},

Hence, there is a need for an accessible and effective tool to assist beginners and novice programmers in learning and tackling the TSP. This paper introduces ScratchTSP, an extension of the Scratch programming Framework, specifically designed for the TSP. It offers an opportunity for beginners and novice programmers to grasp the TSP and the various algorithms used to solve it. For evaluation, we conduct a survey among undergraduate students to assess the usability and usefulness of the proposed ScratchTSP extension. Survey findings indicate that ScratchTSP offers a user-friendly and effective tool for beginners or novice programmers, aiding them in learning the TSP while developing their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.},

This evaluation has important democratic implications but at the same time, consumes substantial human resources. However, until now the use of artificial intelligence such as computer-supported text analysis has remained an under-studied solution to this problem. We identify three generic tasks in the evaluation process that could benefit from natural language processing (NLP). Based on a systematic literature search in two databases on computational linguistics and digital government, we provide a detailed review of existing methods and their performance. While some promising approaches exist, for instance to group data thematically and to detect arguments and opinions, we show that there remain important challenges before these could offer any reliable support in practice. These include the quality of results, the applicability to non-English language corpuses and making algorithmic models available to practitioners through software. We discuss a number of avenues that future research should pursue that can ultimately lead to solutions for practice. The most promising of these bring in the expertise of human evaluators, for example through active learning approaches or interactive topic modeling.},

We don't do this simply to shed light but to influence change. We stand when others are forced to sit and speak when others are silenced. For many of us, the past several years have rendered our usual tools ineffective, and often we find ourselves seated, scared to stand, and essentially silenced as we search for new language to describe old problems. We increasingly, and rightfully, feel frustrate... powerles... angry. Unfortunately, we sometimes allow these feelings to lead us to inaction. However, as the Black feminist scholar Audre Lorde wrote in her masterpiece, Sister Outsider, anger, directed in productive ways, can be transformative.},

abstract = {One of the key objectives of the national modernization of education is the cultivation of creative capacity. This has received increasing attention from educational researchers. Research and practice have shown that primary and secondary school students often face a variety of factors that hinder their free creativity, which increases the difficulty of creative expression and leads to students' fear, or even the phenomenon of halfway retreat. The targeted learning scaffolding provided by human-machine collaborative precision teaching provides new ideas for the cultivation of creative ability. This study is based on the theory of human-machine collaborative learning and constructs a human-machine collaborative precision teaching model for the cultivation of innovative capacity from three levels: human-machine collaborative layer, precision teaching layer, and teaching activity layer. The model is then subjected to teaching design and experimentation with the case of the seventh-grade junior high school three-dimensional design and creativity course, “Bridge Design”. The teaching experiment employs a single-group pre- and post-test experimental design to investigate the impact of the human-machine cooperative precision teaching mode on innovation ability. The findings indicate that human-machine collaborative precision teaching can markedly enhance students' innovative consciousness, innovative thinking, and innovative capacity.},

However, we know very little about how common such courses are, what topics they emphasize, who teaches them, and who learns from them. To better understand computer science education courses, we evaluated the content and goals of 44 university-level courses that teach topics in computer science education, as well as metadata about where and when these courses are offered and the backgrounds of the 36 instructors that teach them.

However, even though people’s personal attributes and culture can have an impact on their perceptions of technology usability, socio-emotional aspects of programming are often neglected. Notably, empathy is an important element for social interactions among humans and previous research has shown signs of possible connections with programmers’ coding experiences. As a result, this pilot study aims to explore potential correlations between Greek adults’ level of empathy and their perceptions of ease of use of programming. For this purpose, an online questionnaire has been applied for data collection to 104 participants who had programming experiences in the past. According to the results, programmers’ empathy is associated with perceived ease of use of object-oriented programming and educational robotics, but not with educational coding games. These findings can contribute further to our understanding of the interactions between users and technology in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Robot Interaction, and Didactics of Informatics.},

abstract = {The Internet makes use of high performance network switches in order to route network traffic from end users to servers. Despite line-rate performance, the current switches consume huge energy and cannot support more expressive learning models, like cognitive functions using neuromorphic computations. The major reason is the use of transistors in the underlying Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM) which is volatile and supports digital computations only. These shortcomings can be bypassed by developing network memories building on novel components, like Memristors, due to their nonvolatile, nanoscale and analog storage/processing characteristics. In this paper, we propose the use of a novel memristor-based Probabilistic Associative Memory, PAmM, which provides both digital (deterministic) and analog (probabilistic) outputs for supporting cognitive computational models in network switches. The traditional digital operations can be supported by a memristor-based energy efficient TCAM, called TCAmMCogniGron. Building on PAmM and TCAmMCogniGron, we propose a novel network switching architecture and analyze its energy efficiency over the experimental dataset of a Nb-doped SrTiO3 memristive device. The results show that the proposed network switching architecture consumes only 0.01&nbsp;fJ/bit/cell energy for analog compute operations which is at least 50 times less than the digital operations.},

In the context of learning to code, such artefacts often manifest as physical entities, including mobile robots, robotic arms, or other hardware devices that demonstrate the practical effects of the code written by students. This hands-on approach has been effectively implemented across various educational levels; ranging from primary and secondary schools to institutions of higher education[20, 22]. The development of digital twins [12] is emerging as a significant enhancement to this teaching strategy. Digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical devices, offer substantial support for contemporary pedagogical innovations such as blended learning and the flipped classroom model. These digital twins enable both students and educators to engage with the learning materials in more flexible and dynamic ways. Specifically, they allow students to continue their interaction with these tools remotely, facilitating continuous learning and development outside the traditional classroom setting.},

Next, we describe children's programming workshops to explore how physical play could be incorporated into coding kits. From these workshops, we recommend a set of coding blocks for physical play divided into four categories: (1) motion sensing, (2) sound sensing, (3) proximity sensing, and (4) gameplay information. These coding blocks for the first time systematically present physical play friendly programming commands, supplementing previous works on developing coding tools to combine physical play and coding for children. Finally, we describe our implementation of these coding blocks on the micro:bit—a low-cost widely distributed computer science educational kit—and describe the results of a functionality test with nine graduate design students.},

abstract = {Although computing is increasingly taught to K–5 students, females and certain ethnic groups are underrepresented in examinations and careers. Disparities have been attributed to students feeling a disconnect between their identities and the computing stereotype. Culturally responsive teaching has been used in the US to adapt resources to start to address these disparities, but less so in England, particularly for K-5 classroom contexts. This study investigates the ways in which K-5 teachers in England adapt existing computing teaching resources to be more culturally responsive. Building on ten culturally responsive teaching prompts (called Areas of Opportunity (AOs)) and a sociocultural identity theory, funds of identity (FoI), we ask RQ1: In what ways do K-5 teachers collaboratively adapt resources to deliver culturally responsive computing teaching? and RQ2: What does a funds of identity analysis reveal about computing resource adaptations?Researchers and 12 teachers collaboratively adapted a set of computing lessons. Interviews were conducted with the teachers post-lesson delivery, and thematically analysed to identify seven culturally responsive adaptation themes. Teachers reported that students drew most on practical funds of identity (e.g., football, drawing), but support was needed, e.g., discovering lower socioeconomic background students’ hobbies. Teacher adaptations aligned with other culturally responsive resources and all ten AOs were useful for identifying potential adaptations. But a prompt to foster community development was found to be missing. The significant contribution from this study is to introduce FoI, not used before in our context. We suggest FoI provides a nuanced view of identity that may be useful to teachers, resource developers, and researchers to reduce identity disparities in computing.},

abstract = {With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain-of-thought(CoT) methodology, the visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub-tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools. However, such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential "determining hallucinations" in decision generation due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low-level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks. This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. To this end, we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework, termed Cantor, characterized by a perception-decision architecture. Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem, ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context. Furthermore, Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher-level information, enhancing the CoT generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

abstract = {Self-regulation refers to the ability to plan, monitor, control and reflect on one's problem-solving process. Prior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve novice performance in solving programming problems. However, with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process.On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design new interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework that incorporates use of generative AI tools in programming problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides exploration of the design space of interventions that integrate generative AI in CS education.},

We then presented Speed Dating design concepts around emotional preparation and support, real-time guidance, training, and suicide detection. Participants wanted more support and preparation for conversations with suicidal people, but were conflicted about AI-based technologies, including trade-offs between potential benefits of conversational agents for training and limitations of prediction or real-time response suggestions, due to the sensitive, context-dependent decisions that volunteers must make.

abstract = {Compared with traditional 2D images, omnidirectional images (also referred to as 360∘ images) have more complicated perceptual characteristics due to the particularities of imaging and display. How humans perceive omnidirectional images in an immersive environment and form the immersive quality of experience are important problems. Thus, it is crucial to measure the quality of omnidirectional images under different viewing conditions, which suffer from realistic distortions. In this article, we build a large-scale subjective assessment database for omnidirectional images and carry out a comprehensive psychophysical experiment to study the relationships between different factors (viewing conditions and viewing behaviors) and the perceptual quality of omnidirectional images. In addition, we collect both subjective ratings and head movement data. A thorough analysis of the collected subjective data is also provided, where we make several interesting findings. Moreover, with the proposed database, we propose a novel transformer-based omnidirectional image quality assessment model. To be consistent with the human viewing process, viewing conditions and behaviors are naturally incorporated into the proposed model. Specifically, the proposed model mainly consists of three parts: viewport sequence generation, multi-scale feature extraction, and perceptual quality prediction. Extensive experimental results conducted on the proposed database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing image quality assessment methods.},

abstract = {Latinos are the largest minority group in the nation and major contributors to the middle-skilled STEM workforce. Although many of these positions require technical computing competencies, they typically do not require advanced degrees. This limited pathway means that most Latino students will never experience a Latino or Hispanic professor, much less stay in college long enough to become faculty members themselves. This degree stagnation presents equity imperatives for higher education leaders to embrace servingness and strategies to build authentic STEM identity and meaningful experiences for Latinos that lead to advanced degrees.},

abstract = {In the process of interaction design in digital media art, it is first necessary to determine the user's needs, expectations and behavior patterns through demand analysis, as well as the way to interact with the design. Then, based on the results of the requirements analysis, the ideas and concepts are developed to determine the overall direction of the interaction design, the core functions, and the basic framework of the user experience. Next, designers need to design the interface for the user to interact with the system, including the layout, visual style, ICONS, buttons, and so on. In this process, user intuition and ease of use need to be taken into account, and consistency with the overall visual style needs to be maintained. Finally, the analysis found that digital media art interaction design received a score of 8.5 and a score of 96% for innovation, which can improve user satisfaction and interactive experience.},

Current development of power system simulation programs is mainly an engineering problem. To play a more important role in the new generation of power system with deeper coupling between information and physics, basic theoretical research is urgently needed. In this paper, existing power flow and electromechanical transient simulation tasks are modelled as nodes for the basic calculation actions and connecting node to construct a computational task network for power system simulation. Several topological characteristics of the computational task network are analyzed, and the relationship between them and the typical numerical computing performance is discussed. This paper attempts to behave as the starting point of analyzing the power system simulation performance and determining the improvement path based on the complex network theory.},

abstract = {Although block-based programming languages like Scratch simplify the creation of programs, learning to program can nevertheless be challenging. Program analysis tools such as linters therefore support learners by providing feedback about potential bugs in their programs. What such tools cannot do, however, is detect whether these bugs are subsequently fixed correctly, even though this is a crucial aspect of learning to program. In this paper, we therefore introduce fix patterns as a way to automatically detect whether instances of bug patterns found by program analysis tools have been correctly fixed, in contrast to the relevant code just having been deleted. Using fix patterns to analyse a dataset of 32,000 publicly shared Scratch projects containing bug patterns reveals that only 2,566 projects received changes and out of these changes not even 8% fix the bug. This implies most Scratchers do not actually fix the bug patterns in their projects. This not only demonstrates that fix patterns are a valuable tool to understand what learners do, but they also hold promise to help encourage learners, and to inform instructors about the progress of their learners.},

abstract = {In the current situation of rapid development of the new economy, new requirements have been put forward for the talent cultivation mode in university teaching. In the future, the new economy will require inter-disciplinary talent in "Emerging Engineering". At present, there are common problems in the undergraduate experimental teaching, such as the limited function of experimental equipment, single experimental teaching mode and passive education of students. In this paper, for the undergraduate course experimental "High Voltage Technique", we design and studies the high voltage virtual simulation experimental distance education teaching mode based on emerging engineering education. The system combines the characteristics of interdisciplinary new engineering discipline and naturally connects the high-voltage course with experimental practice. It innovates the traditional experimental teaching mode into a remote online simulation experimental teaching system, innovative experimental design and validation experimental preparation are carried out, and practical verification is carried out on the laboratory physical equipment platform. The virtual simulation system innovates the experimental course, which provides a new experimental method for the high-voltage course.},

abstract = {Slipped and tucked stitches introduce small areas of deformation that compound and result in emergent textures on knitted fabrics. When used together with color changes and ladders, these can also produce dramatic colorwork and openwork effects. However, designing slip and tuck colorwork patterns is challenging due to the complex interactions between operations, yarns, and deformations. We present KnitScape, a browser-based tool for design and simulation of stitch patterns for knitting. KnitScape provides a design interface to specify 1) operation repeats, 2) color changes, and 3) needle positions. These inputs are used to build a graph of yarn topology and run a yarn-level spring simulation. This enables visualization of the deformation that arises from slip and tuck operations. Through its design tool and simulation, KnitScape enables rapid exploration of a complex colorwork design space. We demonstrate KnitScape with a series of example swatches.},

How two bodies of knowledge and skills are interleaved in a single learning event can be complex to analyse. The sociological framework Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) includes a set of concepts called ‘Autonomy’ for exploring how different knowledge practices are brought together and with what effects. To explore the value of Autonomy in CS education, we analysed a lesson plan of an activity that teaches CS (algorithms) through magic, visualising the findings on an autonomy plane. This revealed ways to improve learning such as by creating autonomy tours. Autonomy analysis has use in reflective CS K-5 lesson design as CS is often taught with other subjects to overcome timetabling constraints, build on other subjects, or to raise interest in equitable learning experiences.},

Previous research has attempted to address this issue by increasing the diversity of information exposure, which is often hindered by a lack of user motivation to engage with. In this study, we took a human-centered approach to explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) could assist users in embracing more diverse perspectives. We developed a prototype featuring LLM-powered multi-agent characters that users could interact with while reading social media content. We conducted a participatory design study with 18 participants and found that multi-agent dialogues with gamification incentives could motivate users to engage with opposing viewpoints. Additionally, progressive interactions with assessment tasks could promote thoughtful consideration. Based on these findings, we provided design implications with future work outlooks for leveraging LLMs to help users burst their filter bubbles.},

abstract = {Code comprehension is an act of understanding the working of source code snippets using technical and cognitive skills. It is an important step in software maintenance as it requires the debugging of source code snippets swiftly. Working under a time constraint require an experienced programmer to demonstrate his technical skills confidently by maintaining his stress-free composure and utilizing his logical reasoning (cognitive) skills efficiently. Thus, it is essential to assess the expertise level of programmers by measuring both their technical and cognitive skills. Therefore, the primary aim of our study is to analyses whether logical reasoning along with technical skills impacts the code comprehension abilities of programmers, especially in the context of technical education and professional practice. The overall proficiency of programmers is determined by measuring the comprehension measure index values obtained through two separate approaches P1 and P2, defined in this empirical study. The approach P1 is a traditional approach which calculates the comprehension measure index (CMI) values of fifty participants based on the outputs provided by the participants through programming data only. The second method, P2 combines the technical and logical reasoning data to obtain comprehension measure index values. The proficiency of programmers in code comprehension has been categorized into five separate classes and based on the comprehension measure index values computed through both approaches, the programmers are classified. The study findings indicate that combining cognitive with technical skills offers a more comprehensive insight into a programmer’s abilities. It is visible from the variations in the categorization of comprehension measure indices among participants when cognitive factors are taken into consideration. More precisely, a change of 26% difference in CMI values, indicates that cognitive skills have a significant impact on code comprehension results. This study underscores the importance of a holistic approach to evaluating programmers’ proficiency, incorporating both technical and cognitive skills. Such an approach not only improve educational strategies in computer science but also enhances workforce management in the IT industry, ensuring that projects are aligned with the comprehensive capabilities of programmers.},

abstract = {Computing education research applies theories from the social sciences to build deep understanding of factors that influence students’ learning process in different educational settings; but in recent years, computing education researchers have increasingly developed domain-specific theories and models that address the challenges and phenomena specific to computing education. Several literature surveys have addressed these developments. However, little attention has been given to whether these domain-specific theories and models have actually been applied to improve pedagogical practices in computing education. In this paper, we explore domain-specific theories and models that are related to teaching computing. We present these constructs and report our findings about their impact on computing education pedagogies, based on our analysis of publications that cite the original papers presenting these theories or models. Based on the analysis of 1048 papers published between 2005 and 2022 in the International Computing Education Research Conference (ICER) and the journals Computer Science Education and ACM Transactions on Computing Education, we identified 31 papers that present relevant theoretical developments in these areas. We further analyze how these papers have been cited and discuss their identified pedagogical use cases in the citing papers. In general, our results show that while many papers refer to these theories and models, there are few concrete connections to presented pedagogical settings and few implications for further research. However, the papers themselves present interesting and relevant pedagogical ideas. We discuss these observations and make recommendations for reporting such connections and implications.},

abstract = {The national computing curriculum in Czechia was revised in 2021 to incorporate various topics, including fundamental principles of the internet and computer networks at the ISCED level 2 (age sim11-15). However, schools face a shortage of age-appropriate teaching materials on this subject. To address this gap, we developed four model lessons and corresponding materials tailored for ISCED 2 students and teachers at two levels of difficulty. The primary objective of these lessons is to elucidate the structure and fundamental principles of the internet, building on prevalent student preconceptions. This work is grounded in the constructivist instructional framework known as Evocation - Realisation of Meaning - Reflection (ERR). The lessons were created and validated through design-based research conducted across six schools, involving 13 classes and a total of approximately 270 students. Pre-post-delayed testing revealed very large immediate improvements following the intervention ( d = 1.72, p &lt; 0.001, n = 204) as well as large, sustained effects months later ( d = 1.10, p &lt; 0.001, n = 59). This paper details the development, implementation, and evaluation of these lessons, providing a valuable resource for educators in various contexts.},

Yet, the integration of generative AI as expressive materials in therapeutic storymaking remains underexplored. And there is a lack of HCI implications on how to support families and therapists in this context. Addressing this, our study involved five weeks of storymaking sessions with seven families guided by a professional therapist. In these sessions, the families used both traditional art-making materials and image-based generative AI to create and evolve their family stories. Via the rich empirical data and commentaries from four expert therapists, we contextualize how families creatively melded AI and traditional expressive materials to externalize their ideas and feelings. Through the lens of Expressive Therapies Continuum (ETC), we characterize the therapeutic implications of AI as expressive materials. Desirable interaction qualities to support children, parents, and therapists are distilled for future HCI research.},

While scholars have looked at overall institutional guidance for the use of GenAI and reports have documented the response from schools in the form of broad guidance to instructors, we do not know what policies and practices instructors are actually adopting and how they are being communicated to students through course syllabi. To study instructors' policy guidance, we collected 98 computing course syllabi from 54 R1 institutions in the U.S. and studied the GenAI policies they adopted and the surrounding discourse. Our analysis shows that 1) most instructions related to GenAI use were as part of the academic integrity policy for the course and 2) most syllabi prohibited or restricted GenAI use, often warning students about the broader implications of using GenAI, e.g. lack of veracity, privacy risks, and hindering learning. Beyond this, there was wide variation in how instructors approached GenAI including a focus on how to cite GenAI use, conceptualizing GenAI as an assistant, often in an anthropomorphic manner, and mentioning specific GenAI tools for use. We discuss the implications of our findings and conclude with current best practices for instructors.},

Data was collected via surveys and interviews, with deep learning techniques aiding data processing. A substantial volume of user data was gathered through user surveys and in-depth interviews, with deep learning techniques employed for data preprocessing and feature extraction. Results show a preference for personalized services and data mining in interface design, while technical features and operational fluency are priorities in programming. Enhancing HCI design can improve operational efficiency and meet individual needs, bolstered by clear visual interfaces and HCI technologies, thus enhancing overall user experience quality and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Technology is evolving rapidly worldwide, making computational knowledge integral across virtually every field. Consequently, broadening access and promoting equity in computer science (CS) education at the high school level is crucial. Certified CS teachers are critical in creating opportunities to provide equitable CS access to high school students. In recent years, Code.org reports have highlighted a significant increase in student access to CS content across the U.S., particularly in high schools. Therefore, this paper provides a high-level overview of Wisconsin (WI) public high school CS education, examining CS teacher certification and course enrollment data from 2017 through 2023 academic years. Increasing the supply of certified CS teachers is essential for WI public high schools to sustain the current growth rate of student enrollment in CS courses or maintain the status quo. While the ongoing teacher shortage in the U.S. is well-documented, our analysis reveals that the gaps in CS education are particularly severe in WI and are poised to worsen. We discuss various pathways available for CS certification, identify four archetypes of CS teacher/CS enrollment access, and explore opportunities from a geographical standpoint. Our analysis offers data-driven insights for stakeholders and policymakers in WI, guiding policy changes and recommendations to improve CS teacher supply. Furthermore, our methodology, using data from the State Department of Education, is replicable in other states, facilitating a broader understanding to identify critical patterns in CS teacher supply nationwide.},

abstract = {Though the increased availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant potential for change in the way students learn to program, the text-based nature of the available tools currently preclude block-based languages from much of that innovation. In an attempt to remedy this, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of using a transpiler to leverage the existing learning in commercially available LLMs and Scratch, a visual block-based programming language.Using only prompt engineering, we evaluate an LLM's performance on two common classroom tasks in a Scratch curriculum. We evaluate the LLM's ability to: 1) Create project solutions that compile and satisfy project requirements and 2) Analyze student projects' completion of project requirements using natural language. In both cases, we find results indicating that prompt-engineering alone is insufficient to reliably produce high-quality results. For projects of medium complexity, the LLM-generated solutions consistently failed to follow correct syntax or, in the few instances with correct syntax, produce correct solutions. When used for auto-grading, we found a correlation between scores assigned by the official Scratch Encore autograder and those generated by the LLM, nevertheless the discrepancies between the 'real' scores and the scores assigned by the LLM remained too great for the tool to be reliable in a classroom setting.},

abstract = {This paper presents an experience report from the CS Pathways RPP, a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) project. Based on a collaboration between two public research universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA, the project aims to establish a sustainable middle school computer science (CS) curriculum in the districts. The CS curriculum is centered on students developing mobile apps that provide social and community good. In this fifth year of the project, we describe the partnerships developed between universities, district schools, and communities as teachers facilitate students creating mobile apps that address community and social issues. We also zoom in to analyze the community-centered implementation by two teacher pairs in two middle schools.Through teacher interviews, survey responses, and recordings of bi-monthly professional learning meetings, this paper builds upon data from two teacher-pairs, exploring themes of RPP, classroom and district community, invested community stakeholders, and the broader online communities formed. The first teacher pair has developed a strong collaboration in the same school, influencing the facilitation of student projects. The second teacher pair highlights a mentor-mentee dynamic, where an experienced educator has significantly influenced the growth and confidence of a novice teacher. We seek to understand two key areas: the collaboration and networks built among teachers and the broader support network as a pathway to sustainable CS education programs. This paper contributes to advancing knowledge of RPP teacher and community networks to establish a sustainable middle school computer science curriculum and advance student outcomes},

abstract = {Music and computer science (CS) have profound historical and structural connections, with programming music offering a promising avenue for engaging children in CS through creative expression. To foster this engagement, our team developed M-Flow, a flow-based music programming platform designed to introduce students to CS via music. Despite extensive existing research in music and CS education, experience reports and empirical studies on K-12 teachers' implementation and its impact on young kids' learning are limited. Therefore, we recruit elementary school teachers and students with no or limited prior programming experience, introducing them to M-Flow and its curriculum through a professional development workshop, a semester's job embedded support, and classroom implementation. We describe the experiences of teachers as they attempt to integrate music and CS, the challenges they face, and the influence on students' attitudes toward learning computing concepts. Specifically, we reflect on our intervention by conducting a sequential mixed-method evaluation. During the qualitative phase, we collected multiple sources of data from three teachers through focus groups and debriefings after a semester of classroom implementation. Thematic analysis of workshop activities, interviews, and debrief videos revealed three themes with seven sub-themes on teachers' integration of flow-based music programming and two themes with five sub-themes on challenges faced by the teachers. In the quantitative phase, we gathered data on attitudes and self-efficacy from 75 students taught by these teachers. Results indicate that the flow-based music programming environment provided an engaging programming experience for students and significantly increased their self-efficacy towards learning programming.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing rapidly in our society and is now apparent in our day-to-day lives. With the recent burst of interest in AI, many individuals and children may view AI as something mystic and magical. It is important to demystify and introduce to them how AI is made and works. To address this need, we developed a software application that allows children to specify the parameters used by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Then students experience how RL is used to train an AI model to play the game "Snake." This software tool was tested with 71 middle school-age students. Here, we describe the design of the TrainYourSnakeAI application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to middle school children, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. We surveyed their knowledge of AI before and after using the application. In this work, our research questions were: (RQ1) How can we create an engaging tool to teach reinforcement learning? and (RQ2) Does using our application foster a stronger understanding of reinforcement learning in children? Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of reward functions and how agents can learn from the environment using the concept of RL. We found that out of the 51 students who were not previously familiar with RL, 40 were able to provide adequate descriptions of RL after using TrainYourSnakeAI.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are poised to reshape introductory programming education, challenging conventional teaching methodologies. This paper presents a scoping review that explores the current understanding of integrating generative artificial intelligence tools in the learning of introductory programming. Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, aiming to inspire further inquiry and advance the understanding of generative artificial intelligence’s role in programming education from a human-centered perspective.},

isbn = {9798331534202},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {While Agent-Based Models can create detailed artificial societies based on individual differences and local context, they can be computationally intensive. Modelers may offset these costs through a parsimonious use of the model, for example by using smaller population sizes (which limits analyses in sub-populations), running fewer what-if scenarios, or accepting more uncertainty by performing fewer simulations. Alternatively, researchers may accelerate simulations via hardware solutions (e.g., GPU parallelism) or approximation approaches that operate a tradeoff between accuracy and compute time. In this paper, we present an approximation that combines agents who `think alike', thus reducing the population size and the compute time. Our innovation relies on representing agent behaviors as networks of rules (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps) and empirically evaluating different measures of distance between these networks. Then, we form groups of think-alike agents via community detection and simplify them to a representative agent. Case studies show that our simplifications remain accuracy.},

abstract = {Blended learning has become increasingly significant for college campus courses typically since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Analyzing and predicting students’ learning performance is essential for providing personalized intervention and guidance. In recent years many machine learning models have been utilized for predicting students’ academic performance, however, these supervised learning prediction models experience strong limitation in their little interpretability due to black-box characteristic. To address this issue, this paper develops a genetic programing (GP) academic performance prediction model to explicitly define the quantitative relations between students’ learning activities and final academic performance in one blended computing thinking course. A comparison is also conducted with conventional machine learning models including ANN and SVR. The experiment reveal that the proposed GP prediction model is a viable tool and can provide more satisfactory prediction performance. In additional, numerical optimization analysis of GP prediction model indicate that most critical factors that affect student’ academic perform in our course are the score of laboratory subjects, following by the score of online quizzes, class participation and online video watching time. The results can contribute to learning about students learning situations and help teacher to provide precise intervention.},

abstract = {Large Language Models, such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (aka. GPT-3), have been developed to understand language through the analysis of extensive text data, allowing them to identify patterns and connections between words. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance across various text-related tasks, they encounter challenges in tasks associated with reasoning. To address this challenge, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting method has been proposed as a means to enhance LLMs’ proficiency in complex reasoning tasks like solving math word problems and answering questions based on logical argumentative reasoning. The primary aim of this research is to assess how well four language models can grade reflective essays of third-year medical students. The assessment will specifically target the evaluation of critical thinking skills using CoT prompting. The research will provide the following contributions; to introduce and educate on the process of instructing models to evaluate reflective essays from a dataset they have not been previously trained on; to illustrate the use of CoT prompting as an instructional approach for training large models to carry out particular tasks. Our results suggest that among all the models, Llama-7b performs the least effectively, displaying the highest mean squared error. Conversely, ChatGPT emerges as the superior model, boasting a higher Cohen kappa score value of 0.53. Lastly, it’s important to note that the selected models do prioritise user privacy by allowing users to delete their own conducted conversations.},

abstract = {Black women represent the greatest underrepresentation in STEM fields, particularly the technology sector. According to a 2015 article in The Verge, Black women make up between 0% and 7% of the staff at the eight largest technology firms in the United States. This points to a glaring problem in terms of equity and inclusivity in the technology sector. Similar to their underrepresentation in the STEM sector, Black women's underrepresentation in the tech sector is related to pervasive and persistent prejudice and biased policies that endure in the United States, which have limited—and continue to limit—their access to quality education and spaces where Black women's cultural capital (i.e., ways of being) is acknowledged and appreciated. For most people, including Black women, social networks often make available opportunities and pathways toward realizing the roles they can play in the world or a particular industry. These webs of relationships and the embedded quality in them can be defined as an individual's social capital and be applied to any industry, including STEM and technology fields. In a practical sense, social capital allows an individual to leverage relationships for resources (e.g., information about internships and jobs or encouragement to persist through a difficult college course). In turn, these resources can contribute to economic opportunities (i.e., jobs) or social opportunities, such as relationships with gatekeepers who work in STEM fields that may lead to opportunities like jobs, projects, or financial backing.Research suggests that the social networks of Black young women rarely overlap with the networks of predominantly White and Asian males, who are overrepresented in the technology field. This weakens Black women's awareness of opportunities and training, and undermines their motivation to persist in the STEM sector. As a result of this increasing understanding of the role of social capital in career development, K–12 and higher education programs that are focused on equity in STEM fields have increasingly turned to the concept of social capital to address the traditional underrepresentation of certain groups, particularly Blacks, Latinos, and women in STEM fields. The following research investigates the experiences of Black girls who attended a program, Google's Code Next, designed to engage Black and Latinx youth in computer science. We argue that it is crucial for computer science programs not just to teach hard coding skills but also to build on young Black women's social capital to accommodate the young women in creating and expanding their tech social capital, enabling them to successfully navigate STEM and technology education and career pathways. Specifically, this article explores a subprogram of Code Next and how it has contributed to young Black women's persistence in STEM, and particularly in technology. The findings suggest that the young women employed an expanded sense of social capital in addition to an expanded cultural capital (i.e., language, skills, ways of being) and worldview (i.e., sense of belonging and self-efficacy) to make sense of their possible selves in the world of technology.},

To discover novel BuChE inhibitors, virtual screening via drug-like ADMET filters, 2D-QSAR modeling analysis, molecular docking investigation to identify the best binding energy. The best hits encounter molecular dynamics simulation. First, 2D QSAR and drug-like ADMET properties were applied to screen the natural compounds (Quercetin and its derivatives). Further, based on drug likeness virtual screening, molecular docking was done. The best hits based on interaction pattern, calculated activity undergo molecular simulation. Based on these studies, 7 compounds exhibit binding energies comparable to reference drug.

abstract = {Students today are facing information overload, contamination, and bloat from dubious sources: AI-generated content, masqueraded influencer opinions, context-less listicles, and consumer manipulation - frequently heralded by graphs and charts to bolster the argument. Because this information firehose presents as technical visual communications, the overload is both cognitive and perceptual, potentially causing more insidious misperceptions than text alone. In addition to consuming such media, students in computing fields work with data to produce graphs and charts themselves, including assignments, academic research, and personal projects/blog posts/tweets. Depending on visual literacy (VL) and prior data analysis instruction, many students inadvertently code misleading, unethical, or biased visualizations, potentially contributing to the dark corpus already festering online. Prior research on misconceptions in visualization pedagogy suggests students benefit from repeated opportunities to forage, curate and critique examples, discussing and debating with peers and instructors. Inspired by these findings, we incorporated a visual curation + annotation platform into a Data Visualization Computer Science course, enabling students to participate in processes of searching for and curating found examples of misleading visualizations, collaborative annotation + critique of examples, and structured self-evaluation of misleading elements in their own work. We assess our interventions with pre-/post-course Visualization Literacy Assessment Tests, qualitative evaluation of student reflections, taxonomic evaluation of formative student-produced visualizations, and post-course exit surveys. Post-course, students' VL increased significantly, and the number and severity of misleading visualizations they created decreased. Students also reflected that they gained increased confidence in spotting visual disinformation online, and in avoiding its creation in software.},

abstract = {The world faces escalating crises: record-breaking temperatures, widespread fires, severe flooding, increased oceanic microplastics, and unequal resource distribution. Academia introduces courses around sustainability to meet the new demand, but software engineering education lags behind. While software systems contribute to environmental issues through high energy consumption, they also hold the potential for solutions, such as more efficient and equitable resource management. Yet, sustainability remains a low priority for many businesses, including those in the digital sector. Business as usual is no longer viable. A transformational change in software engineering education is urgently needed. We must move beyond traditional curriculum models and fully integrate sustainability into every aspect of software development. By embedding sustainability as a core competency, we can equip future engineers not only to minimise harm but also to innovate solutions that drive positive, sustainable change. Only with such a shift can software engineering education meet the demands of a world in crisis and prepare students to lead the next generation of sustainable technology. This paper discusses a set of challenges and proposes a customisable education roadmap for integrating sustainability into the software engineering curricula. These challenges reflect our perspective on key considerations, stemming from regular, intensive discussions in regular workshops among the authors and the community, as well as our extensive research and teaching experience in the field.},

abstract = {Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiments from multimodal signals such as audio, video, and text. Existing methods often rely on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to extract semantic information from textual data, lacking an in-depth understanding of the logical relationships within the text modality. This article introduces the Multimodal PEAR (Preliminaries, quEstion, Answer, Reason) Chain-of-Thought (MM-PEAR-CoT) reasoning for multimodal sentiment analysis. Inspired by the human thought process when solving complex problems, the PEAR CoT prompt is first proposed to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate text-based reasoning processes and zero-shot sentiment prediction results. However, text-based CoT reasoning is not always reliable and might contain irrational steps due to the hallucinations of LLMs. To address this, we further design the Cross-Modal Filtering and Fusion (CMFF) module. The filtering submodule utilizes audio and visual modalities to suppress irrational steps in the CoT, while the fusion submodule integrates high-level reasoning information and cross-modal complementary information in the process of semantic representation learning. Experimental results on two multimodal sentiment analysis benchmark datasets show that high-level reasoning information can help learn discriminative text representation, and cross-modal complementary information can avoid misleading by unreasonable steps in the CoT. MM-PEAR-CoT achieves the best results on both datasets, with improvements of 2.2% and 1.7% in binary classification accuracy on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply CoT reasoning to multimodal sentiment analysis.},

abstract = {In the field of computational science, effectively supporting researchers necessitates a deep understanding of how they utilize computational resources. Building upon a decade-old survey that explored the practices and challenges of research computation, this study aims to bridge the understanding gap between providers of computational resources and researchers who rely on them. This study revisits key survey questions and gathers feedback on open-ended topics from over a hundred interviews. Quantitative analyses of present and past results illuminate the landscape of research computation. Qualitative analyses, including careful use of large language models, highlight trends and challenges with concrete evidence. Given the rapid evolution of computational science, this paper offers a toolkit with methodologies and insights to simplify future research and ensure ongoing examination of the landscape. This study, with its findings and toolkit, guides enhancements to computational systems, deepens understanding of user needs, and streamlines reassessment of the computational landscape.},

abstract = {Topic modeling is a technique for organizing and extracting themes from large collections of unstructured text. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a common unsupervised approach that decomposes a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) matrix to uncover latent topics and segment the dataset accordingly. While useful for highlighting patterns and clustering documents, NMF does not provide explicit topic labels, necessitating subject matter experts (SMEs) to assign labels manually. We present a methodology for automating topic labeling in documents clustered via NMF with automatic model determination (NMFk). By leveraging the output of NMFk and employing prompt engineering, we utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate topic labels. Our case study on over 34,000 scientific abstracts on Knowledge Graphs demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in enhancing knowledge management and document organization.},

Working Groups are now part of CompEd and SIGCSE Virtual. An ITiCSE Working Group is typically composed of 8-12 researchers who work together for about nine months on a research project related to computing education. Working Groups provide a wonderful opportunity to work intensively on a topic of interest with an international group of computing education researchers. This unique experience is one that, in our opinion, each Computer Science Educator should strive to participate in at least once.In 2024, 13 proposals for Working Groups were received and ten Working Groups were selected by the Working Group chairs to recruit members and proceed for ITiCSE 2024. There were 166 member applications to Working Groups, with 134 being accepted including 33 Working Group leaders across the ten Working Groups. This is a record number of both Working Groups and Working Group members at a single conference.Working Groups began their work virtually from March up until the beginning of the ITiCSE conference. Their work included intensive collaboration on-site for the three days prior to the conference. A draft report was then submitted on the Sunday prior to the conference; a few weeks after the conference, the Working Groups submitted their final report for peer review.If the report was accepted for publication, the groups revised it based on the reviewers' comments and suggestions. This dedicated ITiCSE Working Group proceedings volume presents the final camera-ready version of the reports. We are glad that all ten papers were selected for publication in these proceedings for the ACM Digital Library.},

abstract = {A Bayesian network is a powerful tool for representing uncertainty in data, offering transparent and interpretable inference, unlike neural networks’ black-box mechanisms. To fully harness the potential of Bayesian networks, it is essential to learn the graph structure that appropriately represents variable interrelations within data. Score-based structure learning, which involves constructing collections of potentially optimal parent sets for each variable, is computationally intensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data in discrete random variables. Our proposed novel acceleration algorithm extracts high levels of parallelism, offering significant advantages even with reduced reusability of computational results. In addition, it employs an elastic data representation tailored for parallel computation, making it FPGA-friendly and optimizing module occupancy while ensuring uniform handling of diverse problem scenarios. Demonstrated on a Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA, our implementation significantly outperforms optimal CPU algorithms and is several times faster than GPU implementations on an NVIDIA TITAN RTX. Furthermore, the results of performance modeling for the accelerator indicate that, for sufficiently large problem instances, it is weakly scalable, meaning that it effectively utilizes increased computational resources for parallelization. To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a comprehensive methodology for accelerating score-based structure learning, blending algorithmic and architectural considerations.},

This qualitative study piloted a series of lessons leveraging a novel physiological computing environment with a small group of fifth-grade girls (n=5). The purpose of this study was to understand (1) how the physiological computing lesson activities promoted changes in the students' conceptual understanding of conditional logic and variables and their diverse perspectives in computing and (2) how the students approached problem-solving and what their visual attention looked like during physiological computing. We analyzed multiple sources of data, including students' artifacts, recorded classroom conversations, think-aloud verbalizations, and eye-tracking metrics data. Data analyses revealed that the girls demonstrated an improved understanding of the two computing concepts (i.e., variables and conditional logic), employed different problem-solving strategies, and encountered common challenges such as translating the task instruction to building code with the conditional block. Eye-tracking revealed that the students rarely attended to program output during their programming and debugging processes.},

However, the field is only beginning to understand what how AI learning experiences may be designed to be effective and developmentally appropriate, especially for young children. One challenge children encounter is in conceptualizing the “intelligence” of AI while they are still developing a metacognitive model of their own human intelligence. To investigate potential ways to address this, we developed a strategy, metacognitive embodiment, through which children are supported to (a) elicit a mental model of their own intelligent performance on a task and (b) compare that elicited model to an AI designed to accomplish the same task. From this study we found evidence suggesting that engaging children in metacognitive tasks in coordination with AI learning experiences (where the AI performs an analogous task) better positioned them for sensemaking about the AI’s intelligence.},

One of the most popular enabling tools is the BBC micro:bit, well-known for its positive impact on teaching programming and driving engagement in the classroom. We extend these benefits by developing a new approach to coding with micro:bit: MicroCode. Unlike other experiences, MicroCode couples the micro:bit with a low-cost handheld accessory to enable live and portable programming via an on-device visual programming language; no separate host computer is needed. We present the design of MicroCode and the findings of a study in which we interviewed five primary school teachers and 60 children aged 10-11 working with MicroCode. The outcomes of the study show that MicroCode raised children’s engagement and stimulated the development of a strong sense of agency on coding activities, while teachers felt empowered to adopt situated and cross-curricular learning approaches.},

abstract = {Starting in November 2022 with the free provision of ChatGPT, large language models (LLM) are now publicly available. This has significantly increased the number of publications which scopes potential changes caused by the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in various societal domains. The private use of AI and the economic integration of generative LLMs have increased significantly. However, for parliamentarians and parliamentary professionals, the technology often remains abstract, impacting everyday work only peripherally. Due to the special responsibility of parliaments, governments, and administrations as the organizational instances of society, and through the inherent legitimations by society itself, there is a necessity to examine the implications of the use of generative LLMs within these institutions and traditional structures as well as their influence on political system logic. The paper analyzes the responses that the generative LLMs GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 have provided via ChatGPT, based on the same input command (prompt) over different times. The responses help to assess how LLMs can be used in the parliamentary context, to reflect what dangers exist as well as to respond to the question on how a business model of an AI department in parliament might look like. Furthermore, it shall be explored whether there are fluctuations in the quality of the responses and how these should be evaluated against the backdrop of the need for accurate and precise workflows in parliamentary operations. Ultimately, the paper aims to provide an answer as to whether the application of ChatGPT together with the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 could already deliver this necessary quality and consistency for the parliamentarian working environment today.},

abstract = {Emotions are a complex multi-faceted phenomenon. To assess the complexity of emotions from different facets, multi-modal approaches are necessary. However, multi-modal approaches are rarely used for assessing emotions, especially in the context of computer programming.&nbsp;This study adopts a multi-modal approach to understand the changes in students’ perception of emotions&nbsp;before and after working on programming problems. Understanding these changes in students’ perceptions may enable educators to devise interventions that help students adjust their perceptions and regulate their emotions as per their skills. We conducted a one-on-one programming session and retrospective think-aloud interview with 17 students from an introductory programming course. During the programming session, students filled surveys and performed four programming tasks.&nbsp;While working on these tasks, students’ eye gaze, video of face and screen, and electrodermal activity data were also collected using a non-invasive device. The data collection for this study was multi-modal, with a mix of both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. Data analysis was primarily qualitative, with additional triangulation of qualitative and biometric data for select exemplars.&nbsp;The findings of this study suggest that students experience changes in emotions because of many reasons, for instance, they encountered repeated errors, they set high standards for their performance, or they could not manage time. For some students, negative emotions changed to positive emotions when they solved errors without any external help or achieved more than what they expected going into the task. Moreover, the triangulation of&nbsp;qualitative and biometric data of two participants provides a fine-grained analysis of their emotions and behaviors and confirmed the change in the perception of their emotions while&nbsp;performing the programming tasks.},

abstract = {Computer science (CS) education at the university level is often challenging, particularly for students with no prior programming experience. To help scaffold students' CS learning, instructors often utilize systems for automated assessment of programming assignments, where students can individually learn online using automatically generated feedback. However, despite the growing usage of these systems, learning outcomes are often mixed and not all students benefit equally from using these applications. In this study, we utilize Ordered Network Analysis (ONA) to examine data from a system for automated assessment of programming assignments and compare platform activity between novice students (N=110) achieving high (N=43) and low (N=67) scores on the final test of an introductory CS course. We identify and visualize differences in the activity patterns between the groups. High performing novice students tend to request feedback more often, while low performing students more often leave the assignment unsolved after experiencing an unsuccessful attempt. These findings show that Ordered Network Analysis can serve as a useful tool for understanding student behaviors, facilitating the design of targeted interventions that might support learners at key moments in their programming engagement towards task success.},

This study aims to explore the key factors that influence elementary school students to recommend educational robotics courses. Through quantitative analysis, the objective is to deeply understand the variables affecting students' willingness to recommend and to assess the explanatory power of these variables on students' recommendation behavior. The participants were 468 students, aged 9 to 11, from 18 elementary schools in Hsinchu City. After completing the robotics course, these students filled out questionnaires that primarily assessed their satisfaction with the course, the practicality of the course, and their experiences of interaction and cooperation during the learning process. The results indicate that students' enjoyment of learning with robots, their enhanced feelings of cooperation with classmates, and their plans to use robots for future programming education significantly positively influence their willingness to recommend robotics courses. Particularly, the enhancement of students' enjoyment and teamwork skills significantly increased their likelihood of recommending robotics courses. These findings not only confirm the effectiveness of educational robotics but also highlight the importance of creating a supportive and interactive learning environment for students.},

Is it different from, or a subfield of, the philosophy of science education or the philosophy of technology education or the philosophy of engineering education? And how does the study of the philosophy of computing education help us with the goal of teaching students about computing? In this paper, we attempt to examine these questions. We look at the role of philosophical inquiry in the STEM fields and examine the philosophies of education found in those subjects. We first attempt to identify a framework for characterising questions of a philosophical nature that is appropriate for application to the STEM subjects. We describe the categories such questions fall under and consider methodological questions associated with this kind of inquiry. We also look at issues that arise within the philosophy of education and which are relevant when considering the philosophies of disciplinary education. We investigate some of the similarities and differences that exist between these fields and a philosophy of computing education and provide an initial description of the latter. We briefly consider other “sense-making” vocabulary used in computing education research, such as “theory” and suggest reasons why philosophical inquiry should be an important part of computing education research.},

One example is the advent of precision agriculture, which leverages advancements in technology to monitor crops and livestock and precisely apply nutrients, herbicides, etc. for the overall health of the crop. Such innovations will upset the status quo, creating an opportunity for greater equity in emerging Computer Science job markets. However, opportunities in Computer Science are not equitably distributed both socioeconomically and geographically, with most opportunities existing in wealthier metropolitan areas. We surveyed and interviewed K-12 agriculture teachers from Rural Title 1 schools in North Carolina and interviewed them about their experiences, visions of the future of agriculture, emerging AgTech economies, and difficulties they had adjusting to these shifting agricultural domains in their teaching. These teachers form the first phase of the Rural CS+Agriculture Alliance, which will focus on the creation of curriculum to support the integration of computer science topics into rural agriculture classrooms.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

abstract = {At SIGCSE 2022 we reported on a grant funded CSforAll project to develop comprehensive and sustained college-high school partnerships focused on building computer science (CS) teacher capacity and broadening participation in high school CS classrooms. The partnerships involve a wide range of districts including high-needs and small rural ones. In this paper we first provide an update on this distinctive and successful project. Grant funding ended in 2022, however the project continues to grow and evolve. Led by faculty at a small liberal arts college, some of the results are stunning and demonstrate the impact a small college can have. For example, in the last three years the number of partner school districts has increased from 23 to 54. The teacher retention rate is 95%, with the most veteran teachers belonging to the partnership for almost ten years. This update includes two additional years of data on student experiences in their CS classes. Second, we provide suggestions and encouragement for replicating this work. The project provides a model that can be used by other colleges and universities for building long-term partnerships with schools to improve CS education. Important components of this model include summer and school year professional development, curriculum and support for four CS courses, a dual-enrollment program, teacher CS certification pathways, and a professional learning community. We offer suggestions and identify opportunities and challenges for those interested in developing a similar program.},

abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 has quickly spread worldwide with emerging variants originating from different corners of the world and greatly impacting the economy and healthcare on a global scale. As vaccines are being rolled out, there are limited therapeutic options to combat the disease such as RdRp inhibitors i.e., remdesivir. Therefore, this study focuses on the screening of FDA-approved similar compounds that can be in tandem with remdesivir to inhibit exonuclease action. A similarity search was performed to seek related candidates based on reference compounds that show antiviral effects towards SARS-CoV-2. Drug candidates were filtered by employing pharmacokinetics analysis and toxicity screening. Viable drug candidates were chosen based on ideal ADMET properties. They were then docked with the nsp14 protein and five compounds with the lowest binding affinity score were selected. Interaction analysis was also done to visualize and assess the bonding interactions present between the drug and protein molecule's active site residues (Asp90, Glu92, Glu191, Asp273, and His268). Finally, drug-drug interaction (DDI) results aided in determining potential adverse effects when a candidate was co-administered with remdesivir (GS-5734). Based on the outcomes, idarubicin exhibited ideal ADMET properties, shared bonding interactions with certain active residues, possessed the lowest binding affinity score of -8.689 (kcal/mol), and did not show any adverse interaction with remdesivir (GS-5734).},

abstract = {In an AI-driven digital age, it appears that traditional Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) theories and paradigms need to be reassessed, as they should be realigned and augmented to better serve a broader purpose and context. Current Human-Centered Design (HCD) approaches lack the flexibility, volatility and openness to accommodate the new requirements of a highly demanding intelligent digital reality, like randomness, uncertainty, multi-purpose dynamic interactions, adaptability, data-driven design and decision-making, etc. In this respect, this paper (a) embraces an alternative Quantum User Experience theoretical stance – by creating parallels to the fields of (Quantum) Physics, to facilitate the understanding of HCI phenomena in a blended digital-physical ecosystem; and (b) proposes a Human-AI Quantum Experience Design Paradigm that focuses on the dynamics generated by the respective micro- and macro-experiences. Accordingly, the 5 phases: Explore. Define. Engineer. Transform. Adopt., are outlined and brought into perspective of an extended HCD scope. Main aim is to present a promising theoretical standpoint to the HCI community that might be able to address core theoretical challenges and discrepancies, and complement HCD practices towards inclusive and sustainable human experiences.},

abstract = {Social computing is the study of how technology shapes human social interactions. This topic has become increasingly relevant to secondary school students (ages 11--18) as more of young people's everyday social experiences take place online, particularly with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social computing topics are rarely touched upon in existing middle and high school curricula. We seek to introduce concepts from social computing to secondary school students so they can understand how computing has wide-ranging social implications that touch upon their everyday lives, as well as think critically about both the positive and negative sides of different social technology designs. In this report, we present a series of six lessons combining presentations and hands-on activities covering topics within social computing and detail our experience teaching these lessons to approximately 1,405 students across 13 middle and high schools in our local school district. We developed lessons covering how social computing relates to the topics of Data Management, Encrypted Messaging, Human-Computer Interaction Careers, Machine Learning and Bias, Misinformation, and Online Behavior. We found that 81.13% of students expressed greater interest in the content of our lessons compared to their interest in STEM overall. We also found from pre- and post-lesson comprehension questions that 63.65% learned new concepts from the main activity. We release all lesson materials on a website for public use. From our experience, we observed that students were engaged in these topics and found enjoyment in finding connections between computing and their own lives.},

abstract = {While computer science education extends beyond coding, there is a dearth of evidence-based instructional materials for teaching essential non-programming concepts. This study addresses this gap by designing and evaluating three 45-minute lessons for students in Grades 5-7 on cloud storage, hacking, and smartphone app permissions. The lessons leverage the constructivist ERR framework, which promotes active learning across three phases: evocation (activating prior knowledge), realization of meaning (presenting new information), and reflection (solidifying under-standing). Pre- and post-tests (N = 82) demonstrated significant learning gains for all three lessons (d = 0.69 - 1.49), showing the effectiveness of the lessons and, more broadly, the ERR framework applied in computer science education in Grades 5-7. The paper details the lessons such that they can be reused in other contexts and introduces an evaluation of the lessons, presenting valuable insights for both educators and researchers interested in developing effective computer science education resources.},

Additionally, broadening participation in justice-centered computing requires an understanding of students' relationship with social justice and their CS education. In this study, we created and distributed a programming project with a social justice context and critical thinking reflection questions as a probe for an intermediate programming class. We conducted a thematic analysis of 11 semi-structured interviews and distributed a short survey (N=86) with students of this class at a large public research university in the American Midwest. Our findings showed that these students support social justice contexts and content within their computer science education. Students requested deeper dives and discussions into social justice programming that would challenge their preconceived notions, incorporate calls to action, and direct action. However, we also found an interesting tension forming: many students described how their homework problem-solving mindset clashed with the critical thinking reflection questions.},

Amidst these efforts, little research has explored the workplace as a site for novice adult learners to develop computing skills. In this experience report, we present an integrated training curriculum for adults at DataWorks, an organization that trains and employs novice adults from groups historically underrepresented in computing who seek to advance their career through on-the-job learning. ''Data Fellows'' are hired to complete client projects by providing data services for local organizations, nonprofits, and businesses. Training is integrated into employees' weekly responsibilities at DataWorks, and the curriculum consists of four modules: Microsoft Excel, Critical Data Literacy, Python Fundamentals, and Career Development. In this report, we reflect holistically on the evolution of the curriculum over three years. We distill our reflection into insights to inform other integrated training programs that aim to equip novice adults with computing skills in the workplace.},

abstract = {Abstraction is the most fundamental idea of computer science (CS), manifested in every aspect of the discipline in multiple forms. In algorithmic problem solving, which lies at the heart of CS, it is manifested in two ways: 1) Modeling the problem and its components as computational entities, while focusing on essential core details of the problem and ignoring others. 2) Devising the solution by constantly employing algorithmic abstraction. Namely, the solution process involves moving up and down between abstraction levels, where black boxes are closed or opened, and details of the solution are ignored or considered, depending on the current phase of the problem-solving process. Models of this process can serve educators to effectively teach algorithmic problem solving, including algorithmic abstraction. Such models are often used also for assessment, for example, to examine the teaching of algorithmic problem solving or to evaluate students’ performance regarding algorithmic abstraction. In two different studies, we explored the teaching and learning of algorithmic abstraction in different contexts and at different age levels. In each of these studies an appropriate model of assessment was designed by means of combining top-down (deductive) and bottom-up (inductive) analyses. Thus, these models expressed grounded elements, namely, each of them included unique aspects of algorithmic abstraction that were revealed during the respective study. In this theoretical paper, we generalize these models and propose a new highly expressive two-dimensional model for evaluating algorithmic abstraction.},

This paper addresses this predicament by conducting a thorough literature review that scrutinizes the intersection of gamification and augmented reality within Education. As educators seek innovative ways to captivate and empower learners, our exploration not only identifies gaps in current knowledge but also endeavors to bridge them through a strategic integration of gamified elements and augmented reality within a resource-based pedagogical framework. Against this backdrop, we present a use case that exemplifies the transformative impact of our proposed approach. By dissecting a real-world implementation, we illuminate how gamification and augmented reality collaboratively enhance learner engagement and comprehension. Our findings provide actionable insights, guiding educators towards a future where technology becomes an ally in cultivating an enriched and immersive educational experience.},

abstract = {Learning to respond to a computer program that is not working as intended is often characterized as finding a singular bug causing a singular problem. This framing underemphasizes the wide range of ways that students and teachers could notice discrepancies from their intention, propose causes of those discrepancies, and implement interventions. Weaving together a synthesis of the existing research literature with new multimodal interaction analyses of teacher–student conversations during coding, we propose a framework for debugging that foregrounds this open-endedness. We use the framework to structure an analysis of three naturalistic debugging situations (with US 5th–10th graders) that range from solo debugging to collaborative discourse. We argue that a broken computer program is a polysemous object through which teachers and students actively and publicly notice, reason about, and negotiate different debugging pathways. We document students and teachers improvisationally altering a debugging pathway, justifying a particular pathway, and outwardly discussing competing pathways. This paper provides a framework for structuring debugging pedagogy to be less about scaffolding a student toward a specific pathway to a fix and more about exploring multiple possible pathways and judging the (learning) value of various routes.},

Students’ efforts regarding analysis, design and development steps, and project outcomes were analyzed. The study results showed that students’ experience level and knowledge about the accessibility domain were quite low initially. Regarding the target disability type in their projects, half of the students selected mental illness, followed by blindness, deafness, and physical illness. The students who gathered requirements from domain experts or target users made their products more accessible, indicating the importance of user involvement in empathy building in the development process. We also measured increased awareness of and knowledge about accessibility at the end of the course, leading us to discuss the effectiveness of real-life practices in teaching digital accessibility in programming courses.},

A diverse group of primary school students use tablet devices and micro:bits. Unlike conventional methods that heavily rely on basic applications for teaching computing concepts, this practice emphasises the importance of fostering creativity and exploration with physical technology, transcending mere app consumption. Evidence of effectiveness emerges from improved student engagement, a deeper understanding of computer science concepts, and heightened enthusiasm for digital literacy. This innovative idea draws inspiration from constructionist principles and aligns with the evolving landscape of primary education technology. Implementing this practice necessitated adaptability and creative adjustments to the activity. There is a need for further refinement of this approach, complemented by rigorous empirical research methods. This article serves as a resource for educators who are exploring inventive avenues to enhance primary CS education through hands-on tablet-based learning.},

For the first time since 1978, our symposium is being held in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the intersection of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela rivers. We are looking forward to four days of productive and informative presentations, vibrant and engaging discussions, and an overall wonderful experience with our SIGCSE community members. We are confident that our program of events provides meaningful and productive experiences for all.Our theme for this year is "Leading the Transformation". Our theme reflects the role of the computer science education community in adapting educational practice to new technologies and challenges. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforming both academia and the workplace, the computer science education community has a unique opportunity to help shape the future use and application of computing. Our program this year is quite diverse and offers something for everyone, so please take time to peruse the schedule and choose the sessions which appeal to you. Pittsburgh is also an exciting city with lots to see and do, so you are encouraged to enjoy all the city has to offer.The format of the 2025 Technical Symposium is similar to 2024 in many ways. We will once again have a program that extends into Saturday afternoon, including papers and the Nifty Assignment session after lunch. We will also again have three Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, two on Thursday evening and one during lunch on Friday. For online attendees, we will continue to offer streaming of keynotes, the Nifty Assignment session, the First-Timers Lunch presentation, and a small set of paper, panel, and special sessions.This year we received almost 1200 submissions. Submission statistics for all of the Technical Symposium's tracks can be found in the table that follows. Papers were submitted to one of three tracks (Computing Education Research, Experience Reports and Tools, Position and Curricula Initiatives) with reviewing tailored to each track. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers, with a substantial proportion of papers receiving four (or more) reviews, plus a meta review. We sincerely appreciate the work of the more than 800 reviewers and 112 Associate Program Chairs who contributed to the creation of this years' program. Their reviews helped us decide which submissions were accepted while also providing detailed feedback that allowed authors to further improve the final versions of their submissions.},

abstract = {This study examined student learning outcomes from a middle school computer science (CS) curriculum developed through a researcher and practitioner partnership (RPP) project. The curriculum is based on students creating mobile apps that serve community and social good. We collected two sets of data from 294 students in three urban districts: (1) pre- and post-survey responses on their learning experiences and attitudes toward learning CS and creating community-serving apps; (2) the apps created by those students. The analysis of student apps indicated that students were able to create basic apps that connected with their personal interests, life experiences, school community, and the larger society. Students were significantly more confident in coding and creating community-focused apps after completing the course, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, and grade. However, their interest in solving coding problems and continuing to learn CS decreased afterward. Analyses of students’ attitudes by gender, grade, and race/ethnicity showed significant differences among students in some groups. Seventh-grade students rated more positive on their attitudes than eighth graders. Students identifying with different race/ethnicity groups indicated significantly different attitudes, especially students identifying as Southeast Asian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino. Self-identified male students also reported stronger interest and more positive attitudes overall than self-identified female students. Students also reported positive experiences in learning how to create real apps serving their community, while there were disparities in their experiences with coding in general and some of the instructional tools used in the class.},

abstract = {In today's digital era, a diverse and proficient cohort in the computing field is essential for nations to operate, advance, and stay competitive. However, challenges persist in introducing newcomers to computing, particularly in the first programming course (CS1). By exploring the factors affecting student performance in CS1, we can gain valuable insight into the variables influencing student learning and outcomes. This study explored the impact of visual art background on the programming achievements of first-year college CS1 students. Data were collected from two cohorts of CS1 students who participated in quasi-experimental studies conducted at two polytechnics in north-central Nigeria. These students were the treatment groups exposed to Scratch programming according to constructionist pedagogy. The findings indicate that students with visual arts backgrounds consistently outperformed their peers, regardless of gender. Furthermore, the study examined how age and academic achievement levels interact with visual arts proficiency to predict programming success, and found that visual arts proficiency plays a critical role in determining programming achievement, regardless of these demographic factors. Considering these findings, this study offers valuable insights for programming educators to develop inclusive and engaging introductory programming classes. Incorporating engaging visual art concepts and activities into CS0 or pre-college CS curricula could benefit all students, especially those new to computing. Visual art proficiency may also predict programming success, guiding educators to provide additional support.},

abstract = {Scratch allows programmers to create interactive stories, games, and animations using coding blocks rather than traditional textual programming languages. Scratch provides an intuitive, blocks-based interface that makes it easy for beginners to create programs. As Scratch programs become more complicated, there is a higher potential for programming mistakes to emerge. Scratch programmers often encounter sprite behavior, event sequencing, and data handling issues. A testing extension can serve as a valuable addition to the Scratch environment, assisting users in identifying and resolving such errors. This paper introduces the concept of a software testing extension in Scratch that includes an assert block. This short paper provides a detailed motivation for the need to support testing in Scratch through an example that demonstrates how the proposed testing extension can be used. The Scratch extension can help students identify errors within their program and facilitate a valuable learning process through a test-driven focus.},

abstract = {Research shows that the global society as organized today, with our current technological and economic system, is impossible to sustain. We are living in an era in which human activities in highly industrialized countries are responsible for overshooting several planetary boundaries, with poorer communities contributing the least to the problems but being impacted the most. At the same time, technical and economic gains fail to provide society at large with equal opportunities and improved quality of life. This article describes approaches taken in computing education to address the issue of sustainability. It presents results of a systematic review of the literature on sustainability in computing education. From a set of 572 publications extracted from six large digital libraries plus snowballing, we distilled and analyzed 89 relevant primary studies. Using an inductive and deductive thematic analysis, we study (i) conceptions of sustainability, computing, and education; (ii) implementations of sustainability in computing education; and (iii) research on sustainability in computing education. We present a framework capturing learning objectives and outcomes as well as pedagogical methods for sustainability in computing education. These results can be mapped to existing standards and curricula in future work. We find that only a few of the articles engage with the challenges as calling for drastic systemic change, along with radically new understandings of computing and education. We suggest that future work should connect to the substantial body of critical theory, such as feminist theories of science and technology. Existing research on sustainability in computing education may be considered rather immature, as the majority of articles are experience reports with limited empirical research.},

abstract = {Students working on their own, or in small groups, on tasks given to them by the teacher is a typical element of programming lessons. The task, if suitably complex, is meant to go beyond merely applying learned programming concepts to (computational) problem solving. There have been some attempts to classify problem solving processes and to identify how students can succeed or fail in such a scenario, however, comparatively little is known on this part of programming education when compared to other research on programming. This article presents the results of an exploratory, observational study of students in grade 7 (N = 28) that work on a task. The behavior was recorded and qualitatively coded using the CCPS model of Chevalier et&nbsp;al. [6] as a deductive starting point. During coding we inductively refined this model to better explain what happens during that time students spend coding. The newly introduced subcategories were then used to help explain whether students successfully solved the task. The results show that out of a number of variables, the distinction between a more arbitrary and a more purposeful behavior when interacting with the programming environment was the only significant predictor and the different groups are also picked up in a clustering of the various approaches of students.},

abstract = {Digital competence (DC) is a broad set of skills, attitudes, and knowledge for confident, critical, and responsible use of digital technologies in every aspect of life. DC proves essential in the contemporary digital landscape, yet its diffusion is hindered by biases, misunderstandings, and limited awareness. Teaching Informatics in the educational curriculum is increasingly supported by the institutions but faces serious challenges, such as teacher upskilling and support. In response, grassroots movements promoting computing literacy in an informal setting have grown, including EU Code Week, whose vision is to develop computing skills while promoting diversity and raising awareness of the importance of digital skills. This study extensively analyses EU Code Week editions spanning 2014 to 2021 across European Union member states, pursuing three primary objectives: firstly, to evaluate teacher engagement in the campaign in terms of penetration, retention, and spatial distribution; secondly, to characterise the multifaceted audience and themes embraced by these initiatives; and, lastly, to investigate the influence of socio-economic factors on engagement. The investigation uncovers the underlying mechanisms fostering Code Week’s engagement, providing insights to campaign organisers for strategic planning and resource allocation in future editions. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the most engaged areas are characterised by lower income as well as lower digital literacy, restricted access to technology, and a less established computer education, suggesting that Code Week thrives precisely where its impact is most needed.},

GAI applications are in common usage worldwide, yet the impacts of this technology in game development remain relatively underexplored. Through a qualitative study using ethnographic interviews and participatory observation, this paper explores how GAI impacted the workflows, creative processes, and professional identities of early career game developers. We present a case of GAI integration that was not a straightforward adoption. Focusing on the interns’ resistance, negotiation, and reimagining, we show that the interns were actively developing a new professional culture both with and against generative AI. For the interns, their ethical commitments to fellow game developers and the future of their profession were as important as their practical concerns about usability, utility, and efficacy of GAI tools.},

For the first time since 1978, our symposium is being held in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the intersection of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela rivers. We are looking forward to four days of productive and informative presentations, vibrant and engaging discussions, and an overall wonderful experience with our SIGCSE community members. We are confident that our program of events provides meaningful and productive experiences for all.Our theme for this year is "Leading the Transformation". Our theme reflects the role of the computer science education community in adapting educational practice to new technologies and challenges. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforming both academia and the workplace, the computer science education community has a unique opportunity to help shape the future use and application of computing. Our program this year is quite diverse and offers something for everyone, so please take time to peruse the schedule and choose the sessions which appeal to you. Pittsburgh is also an exciting city with lots to see and do, so you are encouraged to enjoy all the city has to offer.The format of the 2025 Technical Symposium is similar to 2024 in many ways. We will once again have a program that extends into Saturday afternoon, including papers and the Nifty Assignment session after lunch. We will also again have three Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, two on Thursday evening and one during lunch on Friday. For online attendees, we will continue to offer streaming of keynotes, the Nifty Assignment session, the First-Timers Lunch presentation, and a small set of paper, panel, and special sessions.This year we received almost 1200 submissions. Submission statistics for all of the Technical Symposium's tracks can be found in the table that follows. Papers were submitted to one of three tracks (Computing Education Research, Experience Reports and Tools, Position and Curricula Initiatives) with reviewing tailored to each track. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers, with a substantial proportion of papers receiving four (or more) reviews, plus a meta review. We sincerely appreciate the work of the more than 800 reviewers and 112 Associate Program Chairs who contributed to the creation of this years' program. Their reviews helped us decide which submissions were accepted while also providing detailed feedback that allowed authors to further improve the final versions of their submissions.},

Standard visual literacy education is less accessible to visually impaired learners. Our study explores visualization education through alternative sensory channels for visually impaired students. This work has three main contributions: examining educational practices for visually impaired students at a special education school; defining design requirements focused on sensory substitution; and developing a storytelling-based assistive learning prototype. The final design, DataStory, is a tactile storybook with embedded visualizations and sonified data narratives. To evaluate its feasibility, we conducted a pilot study with proxy students and a special education teacher. The paper concludes with a discussion on limitations and future directions in assistive visualization education, promoting further research into equitable educational tools for visually impaired children.},

abstract = {Despite the abundance of advice from policy bodies, professional associations, advocacy groups, and scholars on how K-12 schools should assimilate AI and provide AI education, practical plans are lacking from K-12 education leaders themselves. Education leaders must make strategic decisions about how to prepare teachers and students for an AI-infused future. Simultaneously, educators need immediate support and guidance on how to manage the arrival of tools that render some existing educational practices obsolete and prompt the need to teach new skills and awareness. Near term, it may be unrealistic to expect all students to master the ability to develop AI applications; universal AI literacy is a more feasible goal. We introduce a set of short-format, modular AI literacy courses and report how they were implemented and affected teachers' and students' knowledge and perceptions of AI. Using an online questionnaire, we collected data from 265 individuals worldwide who accessed the courses, including 190 teachers who implemented them with over 11,800 students. We conducted 17 teacher interviews to gather feedback and to better understand how courses were adapted for local contexts. Teachers reported an increase in their own and their students' knowledge of AI concepts; and increased optimism about the potential benefits of AI to society and their ability to influence the future of AI. Key takeaways are that AI literacy instruction should be designed for adaptability to local contexts and cultures and that steps should be taken to institutionalize the integration of AI literacy into the regular school curriculum.},

abstract = {There is a consensus among computer education experts and practitioners that teaching introductory programming is intrinsically hard. In particular, the choice of the first programming language to support learning the fundamentals of problem solving and algorithmic reasoning is a hot issue that is driving a lot of attention within the last few decades. As a side effect, the computing education community has been long divided between supporters of industrial relevance and advocates of educational benefits as the prominent grounds on which a first programming language should be elected. While the former seem to have the wind in their sails, with popular-in-industry languages such as Java, C and C++ being still widely used to teach introductory programming, the case is far from being closed. In this paper, we propose to analyze the first language choice dilemma in the light of a number of rigorous studies carried out within and outside of the computing education community. We show that, in the light of these studies, we can efficiently question our choices as educators and stimulate objective discussions toward reconciling our views regarding the first language choice. Mainly, we devise a number of criteria, all backed up with scientific findings from different communities, according to which a first language should be evaluated. Our conclusions converge toward a justified concern vis-\`{a}-vis the use of languages such as Java and C to teach introductory programming, and the pressing need for a better compromise between industrial popularity and educational advantages. To meet that need, our position gravitates around two major opinions stemming from our cross-disciplinary analysis: (i) Java, C and C++ should not be used to teach introductory programming and should rather be saved for more advanced programming courses and (ii) while the recent trend of choosing Python is justified, it is still debatable and therefore other candidates, among which we propose a couple, should also be seriously considered. Besides arguing in favor of these opinions, the primary aim of our analysis is to trigger fruitful discussions on the subject fuelled by cross-disciplinary research findings rather than personal opinions.},

Using data from a laboratory experiment with N = 240 secondary school students, we distinguished between events of teacher-centered classroom discourse (question, hand raising, answer) and teacher explanation by analyzing their transition and stationary gaze entropy. Employing multi-level regression models, both entropy measures effectively discriminated between the two events and distinguished different levels of classroom participation as indicated by the degree of hand-raising by virtual students. Furthermore, using both measures in a logistic regression model, the potential of gaze entropy could be demonstrated by predicting the two events with 67% accuracy. By analyzing transition and stationary entropy, the study attempts to uncover different gaze patterns associated with learning events in a virtual classroom. The results contribute to the research and development of VR scenarios that help to simulate effective learning environments.},

abstract = {In real-world user interactions, complex problems often involve multiple intents, such as retrieval, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and generation. However, existing methods such as ReAct and COT (Chain-of-Thought) are designed for single tasks, resulting in a gap between research and practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel complex problem-solving framework called TAR (Think-Action-Reflection). The framework consists of three key stages: the Think stage conducts fine-grained, multi-dimensional analysis of the problem to form a structured problem representation; the Action stage dynamically schedules execution tools based on the output of the Think stage, flexibly adapting to the solving requirements of different problems; and the Reflection stage assesses the alignment between the outputs from the Action stage and the initial user intent, initiating iterative enhancements where necessary. To verify the effectiveness of the TAR framework, we conducted experiments on two types of datasets. Firstly, we constructed a business scenario dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing real-world problems. Secondly, we evaluated the effectiveness of the Think stage using open-domain question answering datasets such as HotpotQA, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions (NQ). The results demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the TAR framework achieves significant performance improvements across various complex problem tasks, exhibiting advantages in problem understanding, task execution, and result optimization. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the TAR framework as a paradigm for complex problem-solving in real-world user interactions.},

abstract = {Many factors influence computing graduate employment prospects, including human capital, social capital, individual attributes, individual career-building behaviours, perceived employability, and labour market factors. Whilst most computing graduates go on to be beneficially employed, a small minority remain under-employed or unemployed. Computing curricular recommendations increasingly advocate a competency-based approach to bolster graduates' perceived employability. Hence, the discipline is evolving to incorporate competency-based approaches. However, competency-based can mean any of three different types of competency: technical, personal and professional. Technical Competency is the ability to apply acquired content knowledge and skills to develop solutions to unseen problems. Personal Competency is the personal behaviours and interpersonal skills required for success in the modern workplace. Professional Competency is Technical and Personal combined and applied in a real-world context.This position paper provides illustrative examples of how to embed all three kinds of Competency. Based on examples from representative undergraduate computing programmes at UK universities, it provides examples of embedding each kind of competency: Technical Competency (teaching programming through craft computing and approaches for developing cybersecurity competency), Personal Competency (teaching teamwork through project-based learning and creativity via problem-based learning), and Professional Competency (developing work-ready competency using industrial placements, and co-design/co-delivery with industry via degree apprenticeships), providing a valuable foundation and framing for portability and extension in other institutions and jurisdictions. Furthermore, these distinctive types of competency form a helpful taxonomy when considering how to embed competency in computing courses and are candidates for inclusion within future computing curricula guidelines.},

Testing ML applications allows for the evaluation of models against predictions and can help creators of applications identify and address failure and edge cases that could negatively impact user experiences. We investigate how testing each other's projects supported youths to take perspective about functionality, performance, and potential issues in their own projects. We analyzed testing worksheets, audio and video recordings collected during a two week workshop in which 11 high school youths created physical computing projects that included (audio, pose, and image) ML classifiers. We found that through peer-testing youths reflected on the size of their training datasets, the diversity of their training data, the design of their classes and the contexts in which they produced training data. We discuss future directions for research on peer-testing in AI/ML education and current limitations for these kinds of activities.},

Yet understanding and assessing students' learning of debugging remains a challenge, particularly in understudied areas such as physical computing, since finding and fixing hardware and software bugs is a deeply contextual practice. In this paper we draw on the rich history of clinical interviews to develop and pilot "failure artifact scenarios" in order to study changes in students' approaches to debugging and troubleshooting electronic textiles (e-textiles). We applied this clinical interview protocol before and after an eight-week-long e-textiles unit. We analyzed pre/post clinical interviews from 18 students at four different schools. The analysis revealed that students improved in identifying bugs with greater specificity, and across domains, and in considering multiple causes for bugs. We discuss implications for developing tools to assess students' debugging abilities through contextualized debugging scenarios in physical computing.},

abstract = {Theory of mind refers to the human ability to reason about the mental content of other people, such as their beliefs, desires, and goals. People use their theory of mind to understand, reason about, and explain the behaviour of others. Having a theory of mind is especially useful when people collaborate, since individuals can then reason on what the other individual knows as well as what reasoning they might do. Similarly, hybrid intelligence systems, where AI agents collaborate with humans, necessitate that the agents reason about the humans using computational theory of mind. However, to try to keep track of all individual mental attitudes of all other individuals becomes (computationally) very difficult. Accordingly, this paper provides a mechanism for computational theory of mind based on abstractions of single beliefs into higher-level concepts. These abstractions can be triggered by social norms and roles. Their use in decision making serves as a heuristic to choose among interactions, thus facilitating collaboration. We provide a formalization based on epistemic logic to explain how various inferences enable such a computational theory of mind. Using examples from the medical domain, we demonstrate how having such a theory of mind enables an agent to interact with humans effectively and can increase the quality of the decisions humans make.},

abstract = {Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to maintain transactions order and provides probabilistic guarantees to prevent double-spending, assuming that an attacker’s computational power does not exceed 50% of the network power. In this article, we design a novel bribery attack and show that this guarantee can be hugely undermined. Miners are assumed to be rational in this setup, and they are given incentives that are dynamically calculated. In this attack, the adversary misuses the Bitcoin protocol to bribe miners and maximize their gained advantage. We will reformulate the bribery attack to propose a general mathematical foundation upon which we build multiple strategies. We show that, unlike Whale Attack, these strategies are practical, especially in the future when halvings lower the mining rewards. In the so-called “guaranteed variable-rate bribing with commitment” strategy, through optimization by Differential Evolution (DE), we show how double-spending is possible in the Bitcoin ecosystem for any transaction whose value is above 218.9BTC, and this comes with 100% success rate. A slight reduction in the success probability, e.g., by 10%, brings the threshold down to 165BTC. If the rationality assumption holds, then this shows how vulnerable blockchain-based systems like Bitcoin are. We suggest a soft fork on Bitcoin to fix this issue at the end.},

abstract = {Flight delays can significantly affect airline operations. Airlines use inline recovery actions (e.g., speeding up aircraft cleaning) to mitigate the effect of flight delays. Inline (or tactical) recovery for disruptions mostly relies on human expertise that is locally optimal (e.g., at an airport-level). Because an airline is a complex and stochastic network of dependencies, a locally optimal action may be globally sub-optimal. Considering global effects for inline recovery is computationally challenging with conventional algorithmic approaches for optimization. We complement existing approaches with Stochastic Minplus with State (SMS), a novel agent-based approach for inline recovery. SMS generalizes message passing algorithms for a state-dependent stochastic airline network with resource constraints. We evaluate our approach on a real-world airline network with around 4,000 flights per day for two regimes with 1) normal delays, and 2) interrupted operations. As baselines, we use approaches based on greedy local optimality, integer programming (IP), and constraint programming (CP). Our evaluation shows that: 1) a globally informed SMS improves over greedy locally optimal approach by 24.7% in quality, 2) SMS achieves solutions that are better by 14.1% (10.6%) in quality and 7x (9x) in computation time over IP (CP) with timeout, and 3) SMS achieves solutions within 5% of the optimal solution for simpler problem instances.},

abstract = {Programming courses in higher education are often attended by several hundred students. In such large-scale courses, direct instruction is often the last resort, resulting in mostly passive students and limited social interaction. The instructor may present worked examples or perform live coding and the students try to reproduce these on their devices. However, there is usually no live coding where students work on small programming assignments themselves directly in class, because the instructor does not have a timely/rapid overview of the most important common issues that are prevalent in class to support the students. This paper presents experiences with a teaching format to activate students that addresses the aforementioned issues. After students have worked on a small assignment and uploaded their solution attempt within a specified time period, an extended e-assessment system analyzes all submissions and instantly provides an overview of the number of correct submissions as well as all common errors and their frequency to assist the instructor in the immediate tailored discussion. This approach makes it possible to engage students, make student performance visible to all participants, and discuss the most common errors. Students liked "their" live coding, the discussion of "their" errors, and want to do it more often, although not many students uploaded their solution attempts. The teaching scenario, benefits, pitfalls, possible improvements, and further application scenarios are discussed.},

We propose that participatory design involving teachable machines facilitates problem formulation activities. To test this, we integrated problem reduction heuristics into storyboarding and invited a university-based intergenerational design team of 10 children (ages 8-13) and 9 adults to co-design a teachable machine. We find that children draw from personal experiences when formulating AI problems; they assume voice and video capabilities, explore diverse machine learning approaches, and plan for error handling. Their ideas promote human involvement in AI, though some are drawn to more autonomous systems. Their designs prioritize values like capability, logic, helpfulness, responsibility, and obedience, and a preference for a comfortable life, family security, inner harmony, and excitement as end-states. We conclude by discussing how these results can inform the design of future participatory AI activities.},

Combining students of differing skill levels into a single course can have negative impact on the classroom experience making some students feel inadequate compared to their peers. Prior to 2018, our large four-year R1 research university in the United States had a single lower-division programming sequence. Since only a single sequence existed all students (both majors and non-majors) were grouped together in the same courses. In this paper we analyze the impact of developing a dual lower division programming course sequence and deploying a placement exam. Our analysis tracks student performance in upper division courses over the first five years of the dual track programming course sequence, and we present the performance difference based upon the particular track the students take.},

To pinpoint the current state of research on using LLM-based code generators to support the teaching and learning of programming, we conducted a systematic literature review of 21 papers published since 2018. The review focuses on (1) the teaching and learning practices in programming education that utilized LLM-based code generation models, (2) characteristics and (3) performance indicators of the models, and (4) aspects to consider when utilizing the models in programming education, including the risks and challenges. We found that the most commonly reported uses of LLM-based code generation models for teachers are generating assignments and evaluating student work, while for students, the models function as virtual tutors. We identified that the models exhibit accuracy limitations; generated content often contains minor errors that are manageable by instructors but pose risks for novice learners. Moreover, risks such as academic misconduct and over-reliance on the models are critical when considering integrating these models into education. Overall, LLM-based code generation models can be an assistive tool for both learners and instructors if the risks are mitigated.},

abstract = {Most studies in maker education foreground gaps in teachers’ content knowledge or challenges teachers face in implementing maker activities. In this paper, we seek to contribute to a better understanding of what teachers (grades 9-12) see as the benefits of introducing maker activities, especially in regard to equity. We focused on eight experienced computer science (CS) teachers implementing an e-textile unit in their classrooms in which their students stitched circuits with conductive thread and programmed sensors and actuators. Hour-long interviews conducted post implementation focused on: What do expert CS facilitator-teachers see as the affordances of e-textiles for 1) issues of equity,&nbsp; diversity, and inclusion, and 2) their own professional growth and personal experience? In the discussion we consider implications not just for maker education in classrooms but also in creating a fulfilling professional experience for teachers.},

Although several online judge platforms are available, most are limited in that they cannot support a large number of students simultaneously working on an assignment during a fixed time period, or can only do so at a significant cost, making the use of such systems in developing countries non-viable. This paper presents Clearn, a new platform that is (1) cost-conscious, as we have focused on lowering costs, (2) student-led, as we have empowered students and teaching assistants to lead its development and maintenance, and (3) highly simultaneous, as it allows over 1,000 students to work simultaneously on a timed assignment. This paper presents the platform, as well as the lessons learned during its development and deployment, and its reception by the students.},

abstract = {Showing that a problem is hard for a model of computation is one of the most challenging tasks in theoretical computer science, logic and mathematics. For example, it remains beyond reach to find an explicit problem that cannot be computed by polynomial size propositional formulas (PF). As a model of computation, logic programs (LP) under answer set semantics are as expressive as PF and also  (mathtt{NP}) -complete for satisfiability checking. In this article, we show that the PAR problem is hard for LP, i.e., deciding whether a binary string contains an odd number of  (1) ’s requires exponential size LP. The proof idea is first to transform logic programs into equivalent boolean circuits and then apply a probabilistic method known as random restriction to obtain an exponential lower bound. Based on the main result, we generalize a sufficient condition for identifying hard problems for LP and give a separation map for an LP family from a computational point of view, whose members are all equally expressive and share the same reasoning complexity.},

We investigate if we can assess programming skills from unstructured coding exercises automatically using a Matrix Factorization (MF) approach. From the evolution of passed unit-tests over time, we derive a performance metric per exercise attempt. Different MF models are fitted and we investigate to what extent the learned model parameters express programming skills. The parameters correlate well with manually assessed skills, allow us to distinguish the capabilities regarding varying language constructs, and reveal trends in the skill evolution. The approach provides meaningful insights into programming skills that may be used to improve formative feedback in the future.},

The study highlights the value of designing sports technologies and experiences for social sensemaking where youth have opportunities to collaboratively make sense of how these technologies work, such that they can use them productively while being aware of possible shortcomings.

abstract = {Cybersecurity is critical for national infrastructure, governments at all levels, the military, industry, and individual privacy. Both the government and industrial sectors in the U.S. foresee a substantial need for a proficient cybersecurity workforce. To tackle this challenge, the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) jointly sponsored the GenCyber program with the goal of sparking K-12 students' interest in cybersecurity and enhancing their knowledge of cybersecurity practices and safe online behavior. In support of the GenCyber program, this paper presents the first-of-its-kind autonomous R/C car-based cybersecurity summer camp for high school students, featuring an inclusive curriculum that seamlessly integrates concepts of machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity through the lens of an important ML application-autonomous vehicles. Beginning with an introduction to basic cybersecurity topics and technical concepts, the curriculum enables students to explore ML through hands-on experiences such as collecting front-camera images and training an autonomous driving ML model. Additionally, a series of engaging cybersecurity projects are developed focusing on secure shell (SSH) password cracking, buffer overflow attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks. These projects are designed to launch various cybersecurity attacks against the students' self-built autonomous driving models, enhancing the teaching effectiveness and awareness of cybersecurity. Our pre- and post-camp surveys demonstrate that the camp significantly boosted students' confidence in computing, cybersecurity, and ML/AI.},

abstract = {Students learning computer science frequently struggle with debugging errors in their code. These struggles can have significant downstream effects—negatively influencing how students assess their programming ability and contributing to their decision to drop out of CS courses. However, debugging instruction is often an overlooked topic, and instructors report feeling unaware of effective approaches to teach debugging. Within the literature, research on the topic is sporadic, and though there are rigorous and insightful studies to be found, there is a need to synthesize instructional approaches for debugging. In this article, we review research from 2010 to 2022 on debugging interventions. We summarize the common pedagogical approaches for learning and categorize how these target specific cognitive and non-cognitive debugging skills, such as self-efficacy and emotion regulation. We also present a summary of assessment methods and their outcomes in order to discuss intervention efficacy and directions for further research. Our sample displays a diverse variety of debugging interventions and pedagogical approaches, ranging from games to unplugged activities. An evaluation of article results also presents encouraging findings, revealing several interventions that improved debugging accuracy and learning. Still, we notice gaps in interventions addressing non-cognitive debugging skills and observe limited success in guiding students toward adopting systematic debugging strategies. The review concludes with a discussion of future directions and implications for researchers and instructors in the field.},

abstract = {As conversational AI apps such as Siri and Alexa become ubiquitous among children, the CS education community has begun leveraging this popularity as a potential opportunity to attract young learners to AI, CS, and STEM learning. However, teaching conversational AI to K-12 learners remains challenging and unexplored due in part to the abstract and complex nature of some conversational AI concepts, such as intents and training phrases. One promising approach to teaching complex topics in engaging ways is through unplugged activities, which have been shown to be highly effective in fostering CS conceptual understanding without using computers. Research efforts are underway toward developing unplugged activities for teaching AI, but few thus far have focused on conversational AI. This experience report describes the design and iterative refinement of a series of novel unplugged activities for a conversational AI summer camp for middle school learners. We discuss learner responses and lessons learned through our implementation of these unplugged activities. Our hope is that these insights support CS education researchers in making conversational AI learning more engaging and accessible to all learners.},

Unfortunately, assessments can be a source of bias, differentially impacting students along various demographic lines. Differential Item Functioning (DIF) is a method to explore assessment bias. However, DIF is primarily limited to a single binary demographic variable (e.g. white and non-white; male and female). In this paper, we describe a novel expansion of DIF methods to explore intersections of student identities. We demonstrate the use of classic DIF on a data set of 255 complete responses to a CS1 assessment using binary race and gender variables in our analyses. Then, we present the importance of intersectional DIF by running a similar analysis on intersectional data. Using these methods, we identify problematic items on the assessment that are biased against certain groups of test-takers. Our work contributes an innovative method to help interpret assessment results and inform changes to assessments.},

abstract = {As AI-generated code promises to become an increasingly relied upon tool for software developers, there is a temptation to call for significant changes to early computer science curricula. A move from syntax-focused topics in CS1 toward abstraction and high-level application design seems motivated by the new large language models (LLMs) recently made available. In this position paper however, we advocate for an approach more informed by the AI itself - teaching early CS learners not only how to use the tools but also how to better understand them. Novice programmers leveraging AI-code-generation without proper understanding of syntax or logic can create "black box" code with significant security vulnerabilities. We outline methods for integrating basic AI knowledge and traditional software verification steps into CS1 along with LLMs, which will better prepare students for software development in professional settings.},

To explore the design affordances of this system, we implemented scaffolds for eight agent-based models with three design paradigms: content-agnostic, exploration-oriented, and programming-oriented. With log data collected from out-of-school, online learning contexts, our quantitative analysis shows that exploration-oriented and programming-oriented scaffolds did better to engage learners in constructionist ABM &amp; P activities. We discuss implications for other constructionist learning designers.},

abstract = {Learning programming is perceived as hard by many students. To support students, many e-assessment and intelligent tutoring systems have been developed. These systems can automatically evaluate student submissions and provide feedback. Despite comprehensive research on feedback modalities, little is known about students' confidence in the correctness of their submissions when requesting feedback. Also, educators hope that students get more confident and that automatically provided feedback helps students to improve and better self-assess their work. In this paper, first-semester students are asked about their confidence in passing a requested syntax or function test before the test results are revealed to them. Students can request feedback from each of the two provided test types twice in arbitrary order. The self-rated confidence, test outcomes, time needed to enter the confidence, and correlations are analyzed in detail. The results show that the majority of students has a high confidence in their submitted work. However, students frequently over-estimate the correctness and only few under-estimate it. There is a correlation between students' confidence in their submissions and their actual performance, but this cannot be used to make reliable predictions. The test pass rate for highly confident students is higher for syntax tests than for function tests and students need more time for entering their confidence for syntax than for function tests. Over the semester, the self-rated confidence decreases. When tests are reattempted, both correctness and self-assessment abilities show improvement.},

One of them, a data-driven approach, emphasizes providing young people with opportunities to create data sets, train, and test models. A second approach, learning algorithm-driven, prioritizes learning about learning algorithms. In addition, we identify efforts within a third approach that integrates the previous two. In our review, we focus on unpacking how the approaches: (1) glassbox and blackbox different aspects of ML, (2) build on learner interests and provide opportunities for designing applications, (3) integrate ethics and justice. In the discussion, we address the challenges and opportunities of current approaches and suggest future directions for the design of tools and learning activities.},

We describe participants’ expectations of generative AI’s impact, including a dominant narrative that cut across the groups’ discourse: participants largely envision generative AI as a tool to perform menial work, under human review. Participants do not generally anticipate the disruptive changes to knowledge industries currently projected in common media and academic narratives. Participants do however envision generative AI may amplify four social forces currently shaping their industries: deskilling, dehumanization, disconnection, and disinformation. We describe these forces, and then we provide additional detail regarding attitudes in specific knowledge industries. We conclude with a discussion of implications and research challenges for the HCI community.},

Due to the cooperation between the German and Japanese universities, to which the authors belong, an exchange about Japanese CS education was found to be particularly profitable. This paper seeks to establish this insight from two perspectives: the intended and enacted CS curriculum. Background research to the revised Japanese CS curriculum standard from 2018, governmental initiatives and studies of Japanese CS literacy provided a theoretical frame of Japanese CSE. To complement these findings, four interviews were conducted with Japanese CS teachers from different schools. Statements of this enacted Japanese CS curriculum were isolated and, in context with the background research, related to Western implementations. Therefore, this paper summarizes findings of Japanese CSE which differ from Western-centric approaches as learned concepts that are worth considering for enhancing future CSE. These include a holistic way to implement CS in elementary schools, a resource for extensive standards regarding social impacts of CS, and structures for integrated teacher training.},

abstract = {As part of a graduate topics course in Computer Science Education, computer science students on project teams were assigned to investigate an undergraduate CS course. Each team examined course materials, interviewed the faculty member teaching the course, observed a class session of the course, produced a report of their findings, and then developed a research question and plan that could potentially be explored in the context of that course. We report on an interview study conducted to investigate the value of this course project from the perspective of the graduate students enrolled and the faculty members observed. Our findings indicate that the graduate students developed a deeper understanding of pedagogical challenges in computer science and wanted to engage further on the project. Faculty participants wanted more time with the teams and found that participating in the project provided a unique opportunity to reflect on their teaching practices.},

abstract = {Due to a long history of using rote memorization and rereading as the primary means to study, students are coming to the University with misconceptions about study strategies that are beneficial for their performance and long-term learning. Techniques such as spaced retrieval practice, interleaving, and metacognition are proven by cognitive and educational researchers as strategies that greatly improve learning. They focus on helping students to own responsibility for their learning and retention of information. Considering their benefits, quizzes were re-branded to be formative low-stakes retrieval practice activities (RPAs) in an Introduction to Programming Course (CS1), meaning that students would use the quizzes as learning tools, testing themselves in a spaced and interleaved manner as many times as they want during the semester. Additionally, the U-Behavior learning and teaching method was used. This method applies visualizations of student's study habits and self-reflections to help students to be aware of their study practices, reflect on them, and change their study routine to improve performance and long-term learning. Study behaviors were analyzed and the final Canvas exam, final coding exam, and final course grades were compared for students who spaced and interleaved their practice with students who did not. Results showed a statistically significant increase in all grades evaluated for students who practiced using this novel combination of spacing and interleaving integrated with U-Behavior visualizations and RPA reflection activities for learning.},

If progress is to be made toward the inevitable lasting pedagogical change, there is a need for research that explores the instructor voice, seeking to understand how instructors with a range of experiences plan to adapt. In this paper, we report the results of an interview study involving 12 instructors from Australia, Finland and New Zealand, in which we investigate educators' current practices, concerns, and planned adaptations relating to these tools.

abstract = {In order to reduce the significant losses caused by wildfires to the power grid, a transmission line trip risk assessment method is proposed. This method is based on the divide-and-conquer approach and flame combustion model. It involves calculating the probability of a wildfire spreading beneath the power line and the probability of flashover caused by the wildfire. These two probabilities are then combined to determine the overall probability. To quickly obtain key parameters for wildfire propagation, a pole positioning algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer approach is proposed. This takes into account various factors such as meteorological conditions, vegetation, and terrain to calculate the probability of a wildfire spreading beneath the power line. Additionally, a nonlinear analysis approach is used to derive a formula for calculating the breakdown voltage in the flame zone. This takes into consideration different vegetation types and heights to compute the breakdown voltage for the air gaps between conductors and vegetation. By combining this with the voltage level of the transmission line, the flash over breakdown probability is determined. The integration of the propagation processes and the burning characteristics beneath the power line result in a more accurate real-time assessment model for the wildfire trip risk of transmission lines. In a case study analysis, the results obtained using this method were consistent with actual trip cases. Furthermore, the proposed pole positioning algorithm significantly outperformed other algorithms in terms of run time. Therefore, this method can effectively and in real-time calculate the wildfire trip probability for transmission lines, providing valuable reference for emergency response in the event of wildfires affecting the power grid.},

We expand the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework—specifically, Planning, Enacting, and Reflection—proposed in the literature, applying it to examine students’ collaborative problem-solving (CPS) behaviors in a computational modeling task. We analyze these behaviors by employing a Markov Chain (MC) modeling approach that scrutinizes students’ model construction and model debugging behaviors during CPS. This involves interpreting their actions in the system collected through computer logs and analyzing their conversations using a Large Language Model (LLM) as they progress through their modeling task in segments. Our analytical framework assesses the behaviors of high- and low-performing students by evaluating their proficiency in completing the specified computational model for a kinematics problem. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining Markov Chain analysis of student problem-solving transitions with qualitative interpretations of their conversation segments. The results highlight distinct differences in behaviors between high- and low-performing groups, suggesting potential for developing adaptive scaffolds in future work to enhance support for students in collaborative problem-solving.},

abstract = {To foster a sustainable society within a sustainable environment, we must dramatically reshape our work and consumption activities, most of which are facilitated through software. Yet, most software engineers hardly consider the effects on the sustainability of the IT products and services they deliver. This issue is exacerbated by a lack of methods and tools for this purpose. Despite the practical need for methods and tools that explicitly support consideration of the effects that IT products and services have on the sustainability of their intended environments, such methods and tools remain largely unavailable. Thus, urgent research is needed to understand how to design such tools for the IT community properly. In this article, we describe our experience using design science to create the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF), which supports software engineers in anticipating and mitigating the potential sustainability effects during system development. More specifically, we identify and present the challenges faced during this process. The challenges that we have faced and addressed in the development of the SusAF are likely to be relevant to others who aim to create methods and tools to integrate sustainability analysis into their IT products and services development. Thus, the lessons learned in SusAF development are shared for the benefit of researchers and other professionals who design tools for that end.},

As our findings show, while many notions are well understood, fairness, potential to increase diversity and practical applicability are rated differently, illustrating the importance of understanding the application domain and its nuances, and calling for more interdisciplinary and human-centered research into the perception of mathematical fairness notions.},

abstract = {The belief that AI technology is on the cusp of causing a generalized social crisis became a popular one in 2023. While there was no doubt an element of hype and exaggeration to some of these accounts, they do reflect the fact that there are troubling ramifications to this technology stack. This conjunction of shared concerns about social, political, and personal futures presaged by current developments in AI presents the academic discipline of computing with a renewed opportunity for self-examination and reconfiguration. This position article endeavors to do so in four sections. The first section explores what is at stake for computing in the narrative of an AI crisis. The second section articulates possible educational responses to this crisis and advocates for a broader analytic focus on power relations. The third section presents a novel characterization of academic computing’s field of practice, one which includes not only the discipline’s usual instrumental forms of practice but reflexive practice as well. This reflexive dimension integrates both the critical and public functions of the discipline as equal intellectual partners and a necessary component of any contemporary academic field. The final section will advocate for a conceptual archetype—the Public Computer Intellectual and its less conspicuous but still essential cousin, the Almost-Public Computer Intellectual—as a way of practically imagining the expanded possibilities of academic practice in our discipline, one that provides both self-critique and an outward-facing orientation toward the public good. It will argue that the computer education research community can play a vital role in this regard. Recommendations for pedagogical change within computing to develop more reflexive capabilities are also provided.},

abstract = {Background: The growing complexity of the impacts of computing technologies on adolescents’ lives requires them to make similarly complex decisions around technology, fueling a rise in education efforts to look at the ethical implications of these advancements with young people. Though prior computing ethics education efforts integrate ethical perspectives, they have rarely drawn from scholarship on how to teach ethics and philosophy. Objectives: We developed a cross-disciplinary pedagogical intervention that blends ethics-focused computing education efforts like Youth as Philosophers of Technology with tools and best practices from Philosophy for Children (P4C), an approach for teaching philosophy to young people. We asked the following research questions: In a secondary computing classroom context, (1) How might adolescent students express ethical sensemaking when engaging with our pedagogical intervention? and (2) What opportunities for ethical sensemaking might our pedagogical intervention facilitate? Methods: We implemented our intervention in a summer academic program in the northwest US for 10 secondary students (age 14-18) from low-income families and who would be the first in their families to pursue a post-secondary education (i.e. first-generation). We then conducted a qualitative analysis of student classwork and instructor reflections using a combination of inductive and deductive coding. Findings: Students expressed their ethical sensemaking by considering multiple perspectives, questioning the status quo, wrestling with dissonance between their principles and actions, and rejecting the good/bad binary. These expressions manifested in three distinct opportunities for ethical sensemaking: when students made connections to their everyday life, engaged in supportive dialogue with their peers, and interacted with instructional scaffolds. Implications: This study indicates the promise of drawing on pedagogies from philosophy when thinking about ethical sensemaking in computing education. Our identification of expressions of and opportunities for adolescents’ ethical sensemaking while using this blended pedagogy advances our understanding of computing ethics education, and offers insights for other ethics education efforts in secondary computing.},

It is known that such auctions do not always have pure equilibria. In this paper we prove that the problem of deciding their existence is NP-complete, even for approximate equilibria. On the other hand, it can be shown that mixed equilibria are guaranteed to exist; however, their computational complexity has not been studied before. We establish the PPAD-completeness of computing a mixed equilibrium and we complement this by an efficient algorithm for finding symmetric approximate equilibria in the special case of iid priors. En route to these results, we develop a computational equivalence framework between continuous and discrete first-price auctions, which can be of independent interest, and which allows us to transfer existing positive and negative results from one setting to the other. Finally, we show that correlated equilibria of the auction can be computed in polynomial time.},

abstract = {In the ongoing process of the digital transformation of society, corresponding competencies are required from children more than ever. The concept of computational empowerment (CE) promotes confident and reflective engagement with digital technology, which often falls short in formal education. This work outlines how both entertainment and serious games can be used to support the cause of CE and what opportunities they offer for more empowering learning in school settings. The use of digital games appears to be a promising way to connect with the lifeworld of young people and thus offering a low-threshold and differentiated starting point. In this context, the focus should be placed on a stronger establishment of the protagonist role to empower students to engage with digital technologies in depth.In the Serious Game Changers project, students created their own educational modules on specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using digital games and creating new artifacts as learning objects through remixing game elements. In this project, students should be empowered to become active participants by designing with the help of commercial and serious games. Thus giving them their own voice in future (formal) educational settings and promoting future skills in order to make them self-confident 'protagonists' of their surroundings.},

abstract = {Undoing computations of a concurrent system is beneficial in many situations, such as in reversible debugging of multi-threaded programs and in recovery from errors due to optimistic execution in parallel discrete event simulation. A number of approaches have been proposed for how to reverse formal models of concurrent computation, including process calculi such as CCS, languages like Erlang, and abstract models such as prime event structures and occurrence nets. However, it has not been settled as to what properties a reversible system should enjoy, nor how the various properties that have been suggested, such as the parabolic lemma and the causal-consistency property, are related. We contribute to a solution to these issues by using a generic labelled transition system equipped with a relation capturing whether transitions are independent to explore the implications between various reversibility properties. In particular, we show how all properties we consider are derivable from a set of axioms. Our intention is that when establishing properties of some formalism, it will be easier to verify the axioms rather than proving properties such as the parabolic lemma directly. We also introduce two new properties related to causal-consistent reversibility, namely causal liveness and causal safety, stating, respectively, that an action can be undone if (causal liveness) and only if (causal safety) it is independent from all of the following actions. These properties come in three flavours: defined in terms of independent transitions, independent events, or via an ordering on events. Both causal liveness and causal safety are derivable from our axioms.},

abstract = {Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are valuable platforms for testing the tenets of quantum computing, but these devices are susceptible to errors arising from de-coherence, leakage, cross-talk, and other sources of noise. This raises concerns regarding the stability of results when using NISQ devices since strategies for mitigating errors generally require well-characterized and stationary error models. Here, we quantify the reliability of NISQ devices by assessing the necessary conditions for generating stable results within a given tolerance. We use similarity metrics derived from device characterization data to derive and validate bounds on the stability of a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani&nbsp;algorithm. Simulation experiments conducted with noise data from IBM washington, spanning January 2022 to April 2023, revealed that the reliability metric fluctuated between 41% and 92%. This variation significantly surpasses the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2% needed for stable outcomes. Consequently, the device proved unreliable for consistently reproducing the statistical mean in the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani&nbsp;circuit.},

Resisting harm requires elevating teacher voices within curricular design. We partnered with twelve high school teachers to co-design and revise an existing introductory computing program. We qualitatively analyzed post-co-design teacher inter- views to answer the following: (1) How did teachers perceive their involvement in curricular design? (2) What design aspects of the curricular revision did teachers identify as important to participate as co-designers? (3) What design features supported or challenged teacher participation? Being involved in co-design made teachers feel valued and respected rather than deprofessionalized. Holding a safe space with politicized trust was key to their participation, and opportunities to reflect, share, and listen from diverse perspectives were essential. Policies around curricular design work should emphasize empowering trusting teacher communities to advance justice-oriented goals within computing education.},

To successfully introduce CS into K-5 classrooms and integrate it into existing subjects like mathematics and literacy, understanding the key barriers to successful integration is necessary for paving the way for future adoption. However, little is still known about extrinsic barriers within the K-5 classroom and how they can be overcome. Research Question. Our research question for this study was What are the extrinsic barriers associated with integrating computer science in the elementary grade levels?Method. We conducted a mixed methods study, including a survey (n = 160) and a set of focus groups (n = 23) with decision makers in education. We synthesized the results, deriving categories within extrinsic. Findings. We found eight categories of extrinsic barriers: lack of physical resources, lack of curriculum, lack of funding, limited professional development, limited administrator knowledge about CS, limited time to plan and teach, lack of local policies and priorities, and limited community support. Implications. The majority of these barriers are not new and educators can lean on past practices for mitigating barriers. Researchers can also focus their studies on efforts where barriers still remain, such as how to plan, teach, and assess computing integrated with other K-5 subjects.},

abstract = {Objectives. This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies.Participants. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article.Study Method. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers’ readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers’ self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach.Findings. This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers’ self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers’ self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers’ own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum.Conclusions. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government’s teacher training initiatives.},

abstract = {Live entertainment is moving towards a greater participatory culture, with dynamic narratives told through audience interaction. Robot characters offer a unique opportunity to mitigate the challenges of creating personalized entertainment at scale. However, robots often cannot react to audience responses, limiting opportunities for audience participation. In this work, we explore methods to increase user agency in live entertainment experiences with robot characters to improve user engagement and enjoyment. In a between-subjects study (N=60), we create an immersive story where users role-play as detectives with two distinct robot characters. Users either (1) have greater involvement and self-identification in the story by talking with the robots in-character (narrative condition), (2) have a more active role in solving puzzles (gameplay condition), or (3) follow along without being prompted by the robots for input (control condition). Our results show that increasing user agency in a role-playing experience, in either its narrative or its gameplay, improves users' flow state, sense of autonomy and competence, verbal engagement, and perceptions of the robot characters' engagement. Increasing narrative agency also led to longer unprompted reactions from participants, while gameplay agency improved feelings of immersion and relatedness with the robots. These findings suggest that creating either narrative or gameplay agency can improve user engagement, which can extend to broader robot interactions where gameplay elements and role-playing in stories can be incorporated.},

One of the main challenges in e-voting systems is to secure the voting process: namely, to certify that the computed results are consistent with the cast ballots and that the voters’ privacy is preserved. We propose herein a secure voting protocol for elections that are governed by order-based voting rules. Our protocol offers perfect ballot secrecy in the sense that it issues only the required output while no other information on the cast ballots is revealed. Such perfect secrecy, achieved by employing secure multiparty computation tools, may increase the voters’ confidence and, consequently, encourage them to vote according to their true preferences. Evaluation of the protocol’s computational costs establishes that it is lightweight and can be readily implemented in real-life electronic elections.},

In this paper, we introduce the new visual programming environment TestVision for learning unit testing and mutation testing in a hands-on, constructivist setting where test cases can be composed and executed via direct manipulation of visual elements rather than by writing code. We conducted a twofold study on the system with tertiary-level students. In the first study, twenty tertiary-level students were asked to complete interactive tutorials within the environment while their screens were recorded. We used the data to develop a taxonomy of the usability errors in the system. In the second study, nine graduate students from a course on software testing were invited to test the system while receiving a lecture on how to use it, after which their feedback was collected via free-form survey responses and the User Experience Questionnaire Plus. According to the results, students perceive the environment as well-designed, easy to use, and a useful tool for learning software testing.},

We identified the ways that the instructors used their bodies as a shared point of negotiation while co-creating dance artifacts, the participatory role of danceON within the sensemaking process, the ways that the instructors interpreted and translated representations across physical and digital spaces, and the impact of the instructors’ collaborative interactions to their sensemaking.},

abstract = {Fully-external graph computation systems exhibit optimal scalability by computing the ever-growing, large-scale graph with a constant amount of memory on a single machine. In particular, they keep the entire massive graph data in storage and iteratively load parts of them into memory for computation. Nevertheless, despite the merit of optimal scalability, their unreasonably-low efficiency often makes them uncompetitive, and even unpractical, to the other types of graph computation systems. The key rationale is that most existing fully-external graph computation systems over-emphasize retrieving graph data from storage through sequential access. Although this principle achieves high storage bandwidth, it often causes reading excessive and irrelevant data, which can severely degrade their overall efficiency.Therefore, this work presents Seraph, a fully-external graph computation system that achieves optimal Scalability while toward satisfactory Efficiency improvement. Particularly, inspired by the modern storage offering comparable sequential and random access speeds, Seraph adopts the principle of on-demand processing to access the necessary graph data for saving I/O while enjoying the decent speed in random access. On the basis of this principle, Seraph further devises three practical designs to bring excellent performance leap to fully-external graph computation: 1) the hybrid format to represent the graph data for striking a good balance between I/O amount and access locality, 2) the vertex passing to enable efficient vertex updates on top of hybrid format, and 3) the selective pre-computation to re-use the loaded data for I/O reduction. Our evaluations reveal that Seraph notably outperforms other state-of-the-art fully-external systems under all the evaluated billion-scale graphs and representative graph algorithms by up to two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Data-parallel computations, such as linear algebra routines and stencil computations, constitute one of the most relevant classes in parallel computing, e.g., due to their importance for deep learning. Efficiently de-composing such computations for the memory and core hierarchies of modern architectures and re-composing the computed intermediate results back to the final result—we say (de/re)-composition for short—is key to achieve high performance for these computations on, e.g., GPU and CPU. Current high-level approaches to generating data-parallel code are often restricted to a particular subclass of data-parallel computations and architectures (e.g., only linear algebra routines on only GPU or only stencil computations), and/or the approaches rely on a user-guided optimization process for a well-performing (de/re)-composition of computations, which is complex and error prone for the user.We formally introduce a systematic (de/re)-composition approach, based on the algebraic formalism of Multi-Dimensional Homomorphisms (MDHs). Our approach is designed as general enough to be applicable to a wide range of data-parallel computations and for various kinds of target parallel architectures. To efficiently target the deep and complex memory and core hierarchies of contemporary architectures, we exploit our introduced (de/re)-composition approach for a correct-by-construction, parametrized cache blocking, and parallelization strategy. We show that our approach is powerful enough to express, in the same formalism, the (de/re)-composition strategies of different classes of state-of-the-art approaches (scheduling-based, polyhedral, etc.), and we demonstrate that the parameters of our strategies enable systematically generating code that can be fully automatically optimized (auto-tuned) for the particular target architecture and characteristics of the input and output data (e.g., their sizes and memory layouts). Particularly, our experiments confirm that via auto-tuning, we achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art approaches, including hand-optimized solutions provided by vendors (such as NVIDIA cuBLAS/cuDNN and Intel oneMKL/oneDNN), on real-world datasets and for a variety of data-parallel computations, including linear algebra routines, stencil and quantum chemistry computations, data mining algorithms, and computations that recently gained high attention due to their relevance for deep learning.},

abstract = {The classical theory of Kosambi–Cartan–Chern (KCC) developed in differential geometry provides a powerful method for analyzing the behaviors of dynamical systems. In the KCC theory, the properties of a dynamical system are described in terms of five geometrical invariants, of which the second corresponds to the so-called Jacobi stability of the system. Different from that of the Lyapunov stability that has been studied extensively in the literature, the analysis of the Jacobi stability has been investigated more recently using geometrical concepts and tools. It turns out that the existing work on the Jacobi stability analysis remains theoretical and the problem of algorithmic and symbolic treatment of Jacobi stability analysis has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we initiate our study on the problem for a class of ODE systems of arbitrary dimension and propose two algorithmic schemes using symbolic computation to check whether a nonlinear dynamical system may exhibit Jacobi stability. The first scheme, based on the construction of the complex root structure of a characteristic polynomial and on the method of quantifier elimination, is capable of detecting the existence of the Jacobi stability of the given dynamical system. The second algorithmic scheme exploits the method of semi-algebraic system solving and allows one to determine conditions on the parameters for a given dynamical system to have a prescribed number of Jacobi stable fixed points. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic schemes.},

abstract = {Feature-based offline algorithm selection has shown its effectiveness in a wide range of optimization problems, including the blackbox optimization problem. An algorithm selection system selects the most promising optimizer from an algorithm portfolio, which is a set of pre-defined optimizers. Thus, algorithm selection requires a well-constructed algorithm portfolio consisting of efficient optimizers complementary to each other. Although construction methods for the fixed-target setting have been well studied, those for the fixed-budget setting have received less attention. Here, the fixed-budget setting is generally used for computationally expensive optimization, where a budget of function evaluations is small. In this context, first, this paper points out some undesirable properties of experimental setups in previous studies. Then, this paper argues the importance of considering the number of function evaluations used in the sampling phase when constructing algorithm portfolios, whereas the previous studies ignored that. The results show that algorithm portfolios constructed by our approach perform significantly better than those by the previous approach.},

abstract = {Private set union (PSU) is a cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to compute the union of their sets without revealing anything else. Despite some efficient PSU protocols that have been proposed, they mainly focus on the balanced setting, where the sets held by the parties are of similar size. Recently, Tu et al. (CCS 2023) proposed the first unbalanced PSU protocol which achieves sublinear communication complexity in the size of the larger set.  In this paper, we are interested in improving the efficiency of the unbalanced PSU protocol. We find that oblivious key-value store (OKVS) data structure plays an essential role in the most recently proposed PSU constructions and formalize unbalanced PSU as an OKVS decoding process with sublinear communication. Our key insight lies in when OKVS satisfies sparsity property, obtaining the necessary decoding information precisely aligns with the batch private information retrieval (BatchPIR) problem. We give two concrete constructions of unbalanced PSU protocols based on different OKVS encoding strategies. The first is based on oblivious PRF (OPRF) and a newly introduced cryptographic protocol called permuted private equality test, while the second is based on re-randomizable public key encryption. Both our two constructions achieve sublinear communication complexity in the size of the larger set.  We implement our two unbalanced PSU protocols and compare them with the state-of-the-art unbalanced PSU of Tu et al. Experiments show that our protocols achieve a 1.3-5.6times speedup in running time and 2.1-11.8\texttimes{} shrinking in communication cost, depending on set sizes and network environments.},

abstract = {This work studies computation tree logic (CTL) model checking for finite-state Markov decision processes (MDPs) over the space of their distributions. Instead of investigating properties over states of the MDP, as encoded by formulae in standard probabilistic CTL (PCTL), the focus of this work is on the associated transition system, which is induced by the MDP, and on its dynamics over the (transient) MDP distributions. CTL is thus used to specify properties over the space of distributions, and is shown to provide an alternative way to express probabilistic specifications or requirements over the given MDP. We discuss the distinctive semantics of CTL formulae over distribution spaces, compare them to existing non-branching logics that reason on probability distributions, and juxtapose them to traditional PCTL specifications. We then propose reachability-based CTL model checking algorithms over distribution spaces, as well as computationally tractable, sampling-based procedures for computing the relevant reachable sets: it is in particular shown that the satisfaction set of the CTL specification can be soundly under-approximated by the union of convex polytopes. Case studies display the scalability of these procedures to large MDPs.},

abstract = {Wearable sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention due to the widespread use of smart wearable devices. However, variations in different subjects can cause a domain shift that impedes the scaling of the recognition model. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been proposed as a solution to recognize activities in new, unlabeled target domains by training the source and target data together. However, the need for accessing source data raises privacy concerns. Source-free domain adaptation has emerged as a practical setting, where only a pre-trained source model is provided for the unlabeled target domain. This setup aligns with the need for personalized activity model adaptation on target local devices. As the edge devices are resource-constrained with limited memory, it is crucial to take the computational efficiency, i.e., memory cost into consideration. In this paper, we develop a source-free domain adaptation framework for wearable sensor-based HAR, with a focus on computational efficiency for target edge devices. Firstly, we design a lightweight add-on module called adapter to adapt the frozen pre-trained model to the unlabeled target domain. Secondly, to optimize the adapter, we adopt a simple yet effective model adaptation method that leverages local representation similarity and prediction consistency. Additionally, we design a set of sample selection optimization strategies to select samples effective for adaptation and further enhance computational efficiency while maintaining adaptation performance. Our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our method achieves comparable recognition accuracy to the state-of-the-art source free domain adaptation methods with fewer than 1% of the parameters updated and saves up to 4.99X memory cost.},

abstract = {The shuffle model has recently emerged as a popular setting for differential privacy, where clients can communicate with a central server using anonymous channels or an intermediate message shuffler. This model was also explored in the context of cryptographic tasks such as secure aggregation and private information retrieval (PIR). However, this study was almost entirely restricted to the stringent notion of information-theoretic security.In this work, we study computationally secure aggregation protocols and PIR in the shuffle model. Our starting point is the insight that the previous technique of shuffling additive shares can be improved in the computational setting. We show that this indeed holds under the standard learning parity with noise (LPN) assumption, but even better efficiency follows from plausible conjectures about the multi-disjoint syndrome decoding (MDSD) problem that we introduce and study in this work.We leverage the above towards improving the efficiency of secure aggregation and PIR in the shuffle model. For secure aggregation of long vectors, our protocols require 9x--25x less communication than the previous information-theoretic solutions. Our PIR protocols enjoy the simplicity and concrete efficiency benefits of multi-server PIR while only requiring a single server to store the database. Under the MDSD assumption, they improve over recent single-server PIR constructions by up to two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {Curriculum Analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to ensure the quality of educational programs. One desirable property of courses within curricula is that they are not unexpectedly more difficult for students of different backgrounds. While prior work points to likely variations in course difficulty across student groups, robust methodologies for capturing such variations are scarce, and existing approaches do not adequately decouple course-specific difficulty from students' general performance levels. The present study introduces Differential Course Functioning (DCF) as an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based CA methodology. DCF controls for student performance levels and examines whether significant differences exist in how distinct student groups succeed in a given course. Leveraging data from over 20,000 students at a large public university, we demonstrate DCF's ability to detect inequities in undergraduate course difficulty across student groups described by grade achievement. We compare major pairs with high co-enrollment and transfer students to their non-transfer peers. For the former, our findings suggest a link between DCF effect sizes and the alignment of course content to student home department motivating interventions targeted towards improving course preparedness. For the latter, results suggest minor variations in course-specific difficulty between transfer and non-transfer students. While this is desirable, it also suggests that interventions targeted toward mitigating grade achievement gaps in transfer students should encompass comprehensive support beyond enhancing preparedness for individual courses. By providing more nuanced and equitable assessments of academic performance and difficulties experienced by diverse student populations, DCF could support policymakers, course articulation officers, and student advisors.},

abstract = {Nowadays, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), privacy issues attract wide attention from society and individuals. It is desirable to make the data available but invisible, i.e., to realize data analysis and calculation without disclosing the data to unauthorized entities. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving computation method for AI. However, new privacy issues have arisen in FL-based application, because various inference attacks can still infer relevant information about the raw data from local models or gradients. This will directly lead to the privacy disclosure. Therefore, it is critical to resist these attacks to achieve complete privacy-preserving computation. In light of the overwhelming variety and a multitude of privacy-preserving computation protocols, we survey these protocols from a series of perspectives to supply better comprehension for researchers and scholars. Concretely, the classification of attacks is discussed, including four kinds of inference attacks as well as malicious server and poisoning attack. Besides, this article systematically captures the state-of-the-art of privacy-preserving computation protocols by analyzing the design rationale, reproducing the experiment of classic schemes, and evaluating all discussed protocols in terms of efficiency and security properties. Finally, this survey identifies a number of interesting future directions.},

abstract = {This work presents the development, performance analysis and subsequent optimization of a GPU-based spectral hyperviscosity solver for turbulent flows described by the three dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method solves for the fluid velocity fields directly in Fourier space, eliminating the need to solve a large-scale linear system of equations in order to find the pressure field. Special focus is put on the communication intensive transpose operation required by the fast Fourier transform when using distributed memory parallelism. After multiple iterations of benchmarking and improving the code, the simulation achieves close to optimal performance on the Piz Daint supercomputer cluster, even outperforming the Cray MPI implementation on Piz Daint in its communication routines. This optimal performance enables the computation of large-scale statistical solutions of incompressible fluid flows in three space dimensions.},

abstract = {Design Computation is the use of programming in the design of physical systems such as buildings and infrastructure. This involves embedding both general-purpose textual languages and domain-specific visual languages within geometry modelling and engineering applications in the construction industry. A unique form of entry-level end-user programming has emerged in Design Computation. However, there are significant usability and representational issues; general-purpose languages present barriers to adoption, whilst visual languages do not scale to complex design problems.
 

 
In this essay, we explore how advances in programming language research could be harnessed in future Design Computation languages to address these pedagogic, representational and scaling issues so as to improve human readable program structure and semantics and to enable machine-readable program verification.},

abstract = {Background. Programming aptitude tests are of interest since the beginning of computing education research. Many novices have no experience with programming languages before their first course. Yet they have different levels of commonsense computing. Research Question.How successful is a commonsense computing test based on natural language as a programming aptitude test?Method. We developed the Natural Language Computing Test (NLCT) as such a test. Our quantitative data consisted of CS1 students (N=681) who completed the NLCT during the winter 2022/23 semester. We analyzed our test with three methods. These were inter-rater agreement, item response theory, and appropriateness as predictive factor for student success. Findings. The NLCT performed well in terms of inter-rater agreement and accuracy, according to item response theory analysis. However, the test was a weak predictor of student success as measured by correlation. Implications. A test based solely on natural language can succeed as a programming aptitude test. Thus, a programming aptitude test need not be based on prior knowledge of programming languages or related sciences such as mathematics. However, iterative improvement of the developed test is warranted so that it can be used with less personnel effort.},

We conducted a content analysis of 129 YouTube how-to videos featuring children to understand their teaching behaviors and family involvement. We found that children showed several learning by teaching behaviors, such as discussing materials and procedures and addressing an imagined audience directly. However, they less frequently discussed the principle behind the task, asked the audience questions, or reflected on the task. We also found varying levels of parental engagement. While parents safeguarded, guided, reminded, and taught, they talked less about principles and tended to explain rather than asking questions. We also discussed a number of implications for future research and design based on the findings.},

This lightning talk gives an example of addressing this challenge through a novel educational comic book called "Bit by Bit", based on Stanford University's CS1 and CS2 classes, CS106A and CS106B. Serving as a source of edutainment- educational entertainment- and employing personified characters like Fabulous Function and Sir Python, "Bit by Bit" aims to make complex CS concepts more visual, simple, and accessible while providing code-based examples for CS106A and CS106B students to walk through.&nbsp;This presentation will briefly explore the underlying philosophies-including visual thinking, the Fractal Gridding methodology, and educational learning psychology- that inform the novel comic book. These principles can support diverse learning styles while encouraging greater student engagement. Additionally, the inclusion of the author's personal and cultural experiences highlights new possibilities for representation in learning CS. Feedback from the Stanford CS community also helped balance the educational content and entertainment value of the book. This community-driven approach is also touched upon in addition to the potential for replicating this experience in other educational contexts.},

We derive closed-form expressions for the distribution of roundoff errors associated with a random variable, and we prove that roundoff errors are generally close to being uncorrelated with their generating distribution. Based on these results, we propose a model of IEEE floating-point arithmetic for numerical expressions with probabilistic inputs and an algorithm for evaluating this model. Our algorithm provides rigorous bounds on the output and error distributions of arithmetic expressions over random variables, evaluated in the presence of roundoff errors. It keeps track of complex dependencies between random variables using an SMT solver, and is capable of providing sound but tight probabilistic bounds on roundoff errors using symbolic affine arithmetic. We implement the algorithm in the PAF tool, and evaluate it on FPBench, a standard benchmark suite for the analysis of roundoff errors in small kernels. Our evaluation shows that PAF computes tighter bounds than the current state of the art on almost all benchmarks.},

abstract = {Fast regular expression matching is an essential task for deep packet inspection. In previous works, the regular expression matching engine on FPGA struggled to achieve an ideal balance between resource consumption and throughput. Speculation and enumerative computation exploits the statistical properties of deterministic finite automata, allowing for more efficient pattern matching. Existing related designs mostly revolve around vector instructions and multiple processors/cores or SIMD instruction sets, with a lack of implementation on FPGA platforms. We design a parallelized two-character matching engine on FPGA for efficiently fast filtering off fields with no pattern features. We transform the state transitions with sequential dependencies to the existing problem of elements in one set, enabling the proposed design to achieve high throughput with low resource consumption and support dynamic updates. Results show that compared with the traditional DFA matching, with a maximum resource consumption of 25% for on-chip FFs (74323/1045440) and LUTs (123902/522720), there is an improvement in throughput of 8.08–229.96\texttimes{} speedup and 87.61–99.56% speed-up(percentage improvement) for normal traffic, and 11.73–39.59\texttimes{} speedup and 91.47–97.47% speed-up(percentage improvement) for traffic with high-frequency match hits. Compared with the state-of-the-art similar implementation, our circuit on a single FPGA chip is superior to existing multi-core designs.},

In this paper, we explore the effect of increased computed tokens on LLM performance and introduce a novel method for extending computed tokens in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process, utilizing attention mechanism optimization. By fine-tuning an LLM on a domain-specific, highly structured dataset, we analyze attention patterns across layers, identifying inefficiencies caused by non-semantic tokens with outlier high attention scores. To address this, we propose an algorithm that emulates early layer attention patterns across downstream layers to re-balance skewed attention distributions and enhance knowledge abstraction. Our findings demonstrate that our approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding of the internal dynamics of LLMs but also significantly improves their reasoning capabilities, particularly in non-STEM domains. Our study lays the groundwork for further innovations in LLM design, aiming to create more powerful, versatile, and responsible models capable of tackling a broad range of real-world applications.},

At the same time, ICT threatens to exacerbate these crises, as evident in the increasing consumption of resources and widening digital inequalities. As one of the enablers of ICT, software engineering plays a key role to tackle the problems and explore the potentials of ICT for sustainability. However, sustainability in software engineering is still a niche topic, with little structure, a limited understanding of sustainability and few comprehensive strategies. In this paper, we introduce the main concepts of sustainable software engineering, critically review the state of research and identify seven future research challenges across all research areas. We further present our research vision – sustainability-driven software engineering and transdisciplinary research formats – and outline a research roadmap with the key steps to be achieved by 2030.},

The library's computation process is based on adaptive control of accuracies, which propagates the demands for more accurate values from an expression to its appropriate subexpressions. However, despite its unique features, programs utilizing the IFN library often encounter efficiency issues regarding memory consumption and execution time due to its fine granularity of computations. This paper presents the computational granularity control mechanism through fusion transformation to resolve these problems and proposes two fusion strategies, the maximal fusion and chain fusion. We have successfully implemented a fusion system that automatically applies these strategies through program transformation. Its effectiveness was confirmed through numerical computation programs.},

abstract = {Neurodivergent children spend most of their time in neurodiverse schools alongside their neurotypical peers and often face social exclusion. Inclusive play activities are a strong vehicle of inclusion. Unfortunately, games designed for the specific needs of neurodiverse groups are scarce. Given the potential of robots to support play, we led a co-design process to build an inclusive robotic game for neurodiverse classrooms. We conducted five co-design workshops, engaging 80 children from neurodiverse classrooms in designing an inclusive game. Employing the resulting design insights, we iteratively prototyped and playtested a tabletop robotic game leveraging off-the-shelf robots. Reflecting upon our findings, we discuss how the longitudinal co-design process (rather than the resulting game) was key in allowing children the space to learn how to accommodate accessibility needs and create inclusive play experiences. We posit the use of co-design to enhance children’s interpersonal relationships, fosters feelings of ownership, and encourages appropriation practices as a strategy to sustain inclusive experiences that extend beyond project timelines or artefact designs.},

abstract = {Trajectory similarity computation is a fundamental problem in various applications (e.g., transportation optimization, behavioral study). Recent researches learn trajectory representations instead of point matching to realize more accurate and efficient trajectory similarity computation. However, these methods can still not be scaled to large datasets due to high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel hash learning method to encode the trajectories into binary hash codes and compute trajectory similarities by Hamming distances which is much more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conduct hash learning for trajectory similarity computation. Furthermore, unlike the Word2Vec model based on random walk strategy, we utilize hypergraph neural networks for the first time to learn the representations for the grids by constructing the hyperedges according to the real-life trajectories, resulting in more representative grid embeddings. In addition, we design a residual network into the multi-layer GRU to learn more discriminative trajectory representations. The proposed &lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;ypergraph &lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;ash &lt;u&gt;L&lt;/u&gt;earning for &lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;rajectory similarity commutation is an end-to-end framework and named HHL-Traj. Experimental results on two real-world trajectory datasets (i.e., Porto and Beijing) demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves up to 6.23% and 15.42% accuracy gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines in unhashed and hashed cases, respectively. The efficiency of trajectory similarity computation based on hash codes is also verified. Our code is available at https://github.com/caoyuan57/HHL-Traj.},

This paper explores addressing this exclusionary gap by introducing children with emotional and behavioral disorders to programming at an early age, using the popular programming environments Scratch and Sonic Pi. The primary aim of this initiative is to provide children with such disorders an opportunity to develop critical skills through programming, ultimately promoting their affections and empowering them. Overall, our programming courses demonstrate that it is feasible to successfully teach children with emotional and behavioral disorders basic programming skills while having fun and significantly increasing their self-efficacy. There are, however, unique challenges in running such courses. Based on our experiences, we therefore provide recommendations for educators and researchers working with children with emotional and behavioral disorders in programming education.},

Most students struggle to understand nondeterministic computation models like nondeterministic finite-state machines, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. Often, students find it difficult to understand why a nondeterministic machine accepts or rejects a word. Furthermore, they may feel uncomfortable with there being multiple computations on the same input and with a computation not consuming all of its input. This article presents a visualization tool developed to help students understand nondeterministic behavior. The tool is integrated into FSM--a domain-specific language for the Automata Theory classroom. The strategy is based on the automatic generation of computation graphs. Unlike previous visualization tools, the computation graphs generated reflect the structure of the given machine's transition diagram and not the structure of the computation tree. Empirical data collected from students at two universities suggests that the visualizations are well-received and useful.},

abstract = {Background and Context. Instruction in most introductory computing courses is typically focused on how to program. However, non-majors who take computing courses have a diverse set of desired endpoints. One group of non-majors are the conversational programmers, who do not want to program in their career but enroll in computing courses to improve their ability to communicate about technical topics and their competitiveness in the job market. Research suggests that these learners need an alternate instructional approach, but so far, conversational programmers in higher educational contexts have only been studied in a limited number of small-scale studies. Objectives. To inform curriculum design for conversational programmers at the university level, we (a) examine the prevalence of conversational programmers among non-majors and their characteristics, (b) understand conversational programmers’ desired learning goals and classroom activities, and (c) investigate factors associated with these learners’ motivation to learn computing. Methods. We designed a survey based on Expectancy-Value Theory and prior work about conversational programmers. We collected responses from randomly sampled non-major students at a large public university, and we analyzed the survey data with descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings. We found that conversational programmers are the largest proportion of non-majors in our sample, both overall and across historically underrepresented groups in CS. We replicated prior findings of low self-efficacy for programming of conversational programmers. We found that conversational programmers’ motivation for taking more computing courses is paradoxically driven more by their interest in computing than its utility, despite their general lack of enjoyment in computing. We validate a previously proposed set of conversational programmers’ learning goals and show that they value employment-oriented learning goals over those focused on conversations. Implications. Our results suggest that addressing the needs of conversational programmers can contribute to broadening participation in computing. Our study motivates a learner-centered curriculum design that could address conversational programmers’ learning needs by enhancing their self-efficacy and interests prior to focusing on conversational goals.},

They have been shown to be significantly faster than traditional serial and batch evaluation, by sharing computation across instances. However, writing correct multi-instance algorithms is challenging; and in this work, we describe AutoMI, a framework for automatically converting vertex-centric graph algorithms into their vectorized multi-instance versions. We also develop an algebraic characterization of algorithms that can benefit best from multi-instance computation with simpler and faster streamlined vectorization. This allows users to decide when to use such optimization and instruct AutoMI to make the best use of SIMD vectorization. Using 6 real-life graphs, we show that AutoMI-converted multi-instance algorithms are 9.6 to 29.5 times faster than serial evaluation, 7.1 to 26.4 times faster than batch evaluation, and are even 2.6 to 4.6 times faster than existing highly optimized handcrafted multi-instance algorithms without vectorization.},

abstract = {In order to cope with the problem of insufficient resources on mobile devices, the combination of blockchain and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has attracted much attention. In this paper, we consider an edge-enabled blockchain system containing two types of miners and a single Edge Service Provider (ESP). Different types of miners have different resource requirements and corresponding prices. Each miner makes a computation offloading decision based on the resource price set by ESP. Different miners possess varying resource requirements and correspond to distinct prices. Miners formulate task offloading decisions based on the prices set by ESP for different resource types. The ESP dynamically adjusts resource price based on miners' offloading requests and makes admission control according to resource usage in each time slot. The problem is a joint optimization problem of computation offloading, price strategy, and admission control, we model the problem as a sequential decision-making problem and use a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Through simulation experiments, our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the overall social utility.},

abstract = {Researchers across various fields seek to understand causal relationships but often find controlled experiments impractical. To address this, statistical tools for causal discovery from naturally observed data have become crucial. Non-linear regression models, such as Gaussian process regression, are commonly used in causal inference but have limitations due to high costs when adapted for secure computation. Support vector regression (SVR) offers an alternative but remains costly in an Multi-party computation context due to conditional branches and support vector updates.In this paper, we propose Aitia, the first two-party secure computation protocol for bivariate causal discovery. The protocol is based on optimized multi-party computation design choices and is secure in the semi-honest setting. At the core of our approach is BSGD-SVR, a new non-linear regression algorithm designed for MPC applications, achieving both high accuracy and low computation and communication costs. Specifically, we reduce the training complexity of the non-linear regression model from approximately from O(N3) to O(N2) where N is the number of training samples. We implement Aitia using CrypTen and assess its performance across various datasets. Empirical evaluations show a significant speedup of 3.6x to 340x compared to the baseline approach.},

However, we currently lack a systematic view of this emerging field, which hinders the research and design of new joint media experiences and technologies for families. In this work, we conduct a scoping review of parent-child JME research within HCI (N = 89) and analyze the included papers from three lenses: publication features, methodological features, and JME features. Based on these findings, we identify gaps and opportunities in parent-child JME research and further expand the theoretical framing of JME by developing a framework that captures different JME dimensions.},

abstract = {The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model quality by scaling up model parameters. However, its development is hindered in distributed training scenarios due to significant communication overhead and expert load imbalance. Existing methods, which only allow for coarse-grained overlapping of communication and computation, slightly alleviate communication costs but at the same time, they introduce a notable impairment of computational efficiency. Furthermore, current approaches to addressing load imbalance often compromise model quality.We introduce CCFuser, a novel framework designed for efficient training of MoE models. CCFuser replaces the costly All2All operations typical in MoE architectures with efficient inter-GPU shared memory access. This allows for the concurrent computation of local and remote data within a fused kernel, achieving substantially higher compute FLOPS for GEMM operations. Additionally, CCFuser addresses load imbalance with a resource-efficient expert reassignment strategy, which optimizes the use of computational resources in expert reassignment through equivalent graph transformations without sacrificing statistical accuracy. By integrating these optimizations, CCFuser significantly enhances GPU utilization efficiency. Experiments conducted on A100 servers show that CCFuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods FastMoE and FasterMoE by an average of 2.96x and 2.48x, respectively, achieving a maximum speedup of 4.34x.},

abstract = {Metaphor is to express another thing through one thing, it is not only a rhetorical means, but also embodies a kind of analogical cognition and way of thinking of people. In recent years, metaphors have made more and more progress in Chinese language recognition, so their status has gradually risen. Chinese language sentiment analysis is a relatively difficult problem in language processing. Chinese language semantics is ambiguous and complex, so it is a great challenge to construct Chinese Emotion structure. In this paper, Chinese nouns and Chinese verbs are used as test samples to conduct metaphor test calculation. The test results of mutual information and information entropy show that for the sample metaphor calculation, the correct rate of individual words is less than 70%. The ratio between the macro-average of gerund words and the baseline fluctuates relatively large. The metaphor recognition of nouns is about 20% higher than the original test results and about 10% higher for verbs. It shows that under the action of mutual information and information entropy, the metaphor recognition performance of the basic structure of Chinese Emotion constructed from the perspective of metaphor is improved, and further illustrates the feasibility of mutual information and information entropy algorithm for building the basic structure.},

abstract = {Stencil computations play a pivotal role in numerous scientific and industrial applications, yet their efficient execution on specialized hardware accelerators like Tensor Core Units (TCUs) remains a challenge. This paper introduces LoRAStencil1, a novel stencil computing system designed to mitigate memory access redundancies on TCUs through low-rank adaptation. We first identify a nuanced form of this redundancy, dimension residue, specific to TCUs. Then LoRAStencil leverages orchestrated mathematical transformations to decompose stencil weight matrices into smaller rank-1 matrices, facilitating efficient data gathering along residual dimensions. It comprises three key components: memory-efficient Residual Dimension Gathering to facilitate more data reuse, compute-saving Pyramidal Matrix Adaptation to exploit the inherent low-rank characteristics, and performance-boosting Butterfly Vector Swapping to circumvent all data shuffles. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that LoRAStencil address dimension residues effectively, which outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a 2.16x speedup, offering promising advancements for efficient tensorized stencil computation on TCUs by Low-Rank Adaptation.},

abstract = {Secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols enable n parties, each with private inputs, to compute a given function without leaking information beyond the outputs. One of the main approaches to designing efficient MPC protocols is to use secret sharing. In general, secret sharing based MPC contains three phases: input sharing, circuit evaluation, and output recovery. If the adversary corrupts at most t parties, the protocol typically uses (t,n) threshold secret sharing to share the inputs. In this work, we consider a weaker variant of threshold secret sharing called lazy threshold secret sharing (or simply lazy sharing) and show that: Lazy sharing can serve as a viable alternative to threshold secret sharing in MPC without compromising security. Lazy sharing could be generated more efficiently than threshold secret sharing.As a result, replacing threshold secret sharing with lazy sharing can lead to a more efficient input sharing phase. Moreover, we propose that the efficiency of the circuit evaluation phase can also be further improved. To support this claim, we apply lazy sharing to several state-of-the-art MPC protocols and analyze the efficiency gain in various settings. These protocols include the GMW protocol (Goldreich et al., STOC 1987), the AFLNO protocol (Araki et al., CCS 2016), and the SPDZ protocol (Damg\r{a}rd et al., CRYPTO 2012). By doing so, we analyze the efficiency gains in various settings and highlight the advantages of incorporating lazy sharing into MPC protocols.},

These functions can be composed into pipelines, supporting the systematic development of graph algorithms. For this paper, our focus lies in particular on the capability to implement the well- established computational models for graph processing within the proposed framework.

abstract = {Privacy-preserving graph analysis allows performing computations on graphs that store sensitive information while ensuring all the information about the topology of the graph, as well as data associated with the nodes and edges, remains hidden. The current work addresses this problem by designing a highly scalable framework, Graphiti, that allows securely realising any graph algorithm. Graphiti relies on the technique of secure multiparty computation (MPC) to design a generic framework that improves over the state-of-the-art framework of GraphSC by Araki et al. (CCS'21). The key technical contribution is that Graphiti has round complexity independent of the graph size, which in turn allows attaining the desired scalability. Specifically, this is achieved by (i) decoupling the Scatter primitive of GraphSC into separate operations of Propagate and ApplyE, (ii) designing a novel constant-round approach to realise Propagate, as well as (iii) designing a novel constant-round approach to realise the Gather primitive of GraphSC by leveraging the linearity of the aggregation operation. We benchmark the performance of Graphiti for the application of contact tracing via BFS for 10 hops and observe that it takes less than 2 minutes when computing over a graph of size 10^7. Concretely it improves over the state-of-the-art up to a factor of 1034\texttimes{} in online run time. Similar to GraphSC by Araki et al., since Graphiti relies on a secure protocol for shuffle, we additionally design a shuffle protocol secure against a semi-honest adversary in the 2-party with a helper setting. Given the versatility of shuffle protocol, the designed solution is of independent interest. Hence, we also benchmark the performance of the designed shuffle where we observe improvements of up to 1.83\texttimes{} in online run time when considering an input vector of size 10^7, in comparison to the state-of-the-art in the considered setting.},

abstract = {Big data has proven to be a very useful tool for companies and users, but companies with larger datasets have ended being more competitive than the others thanks to machine learning or artificial intelligence. Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) allows the smaller companies to jointly train arbitrary models on their private data while assuring privacy, and thus gives data owners the ability to perform what are currently known as federated learning algorithms. Besides, with a blockchain it is possible to coordinate and audit those computations in a decentralized way.In this document, we consider a private data marketplace as a space where researchers and data owners meet to agree the use of private data for statistics or more complex model trainings. This document presents a candidate architecure for a private data marketplace by combining SMPC and a public, general-purpose blockchain. Such a marketplace is proposed as a smart contract deployed in the blockchain, while the privacy preserving computation is held by SMPC.},

abstract = {Estimating influential parameters in real-world applications can be challenging, especially in problems where the model likelihood is intractable. To perform inference, the machine learning model should be able to understand the underlying phenomena and conditions which have led to the observations in hand. Estimating the posterior distribution of the influential parameters given observations (the inverse problem) can therefore be onerous, especially when the likelihood is intractable. The Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) paradigm is the standard statistical methodology to address such likelihood-free problems. In a nutshell, ABC methods establish a proxy for the likelihood based on data simulations. Two main bottlenecks of any ABC technique are the comparisons between observed and simulated datasets, and the manner via which data must be summarized in order to make the eventual data comparisons optimally fit for the inference purpose. We propose an ABC algorithm that learns how to perform data summarization in a data-driven manner, which is not based on pre-selecting summary statistics a priori. The proposed ABC algorithm is based on a neural network which is trained via adversarial learning. We show how the proposed ABC algorithm can infer the posterior distributions of parameters with high fidelity, and with low bias and variance. We apply the algorithm to two different applications and demonstrate its efficacy and robustness with respect to parameter inference.},

We propose PrivatEyes - the first privacy-enhancing training approach for appearance-based gaze estimation based on federated learning (FL) and secure multi-party computation (MPC). PrivatEyes enables training gaze estimators on multiple local datasets across different users and server-based secure aggregation of the individual estimators' updates. PrivatEyes guarantees that individual gaze data remains private even if a majority of the aggregating servers is malicious. We also introduce a new data leakage attack DualView that shows that PrivatEyes limits the leakage of private training data more effectively than previous approaches. Evaluations on the MPIIGaze, MPIIFaceGaze, GazeCapture, and NVGaze datasets further show that the improved privacy does not lead to a lower gaze estimation accuracy or substantially higher computational costs - both of which are on par with its non-secure counterparts.},

abstract = {Why and how do new media artists teach computing? Over the past decade, computing has become a part of the standard curriculum in university art and design departments, along with the advent of influential informal learning communities and self-organized schools. This paper is the first systematic attempt to map the diverse conditions, motivations, and practices of new media artists teaching computing. Interviews with 18 new media artists from 5 countries and 17 different sites revealed that teaching computing is closely integrated with their art practice, with a shared aim to cultivate new cultures in computing rather than only to transfer knowledge. We gathered new media artists’ accounts of precarious work, lack of time and place for their practices, and unrealistic expectations for instant results they face in their teaching. Within these precarious conditions, they developed a unique set of practices for “perpetual teaching,” which promotes self-reflective, critical, and situated learning. Our findings from this study are a call for further investigation of educators’ roles in creating cultures in computing, especially incorporating practices outside of conventional computing education settings.},

While children's interactive partners have traditionally been their parents and teachers, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked a surge of AI-based storytelling and reading technologies. As these technologies become increasingly ubiquitous in preschoolers' lives, questions arise regarding how they function in practical storytelling and reading scenarios and, how parents, the most critical stakeholders, experience and perceive these technologies. This paper investigates these questions through a qualitative study with 17 parents of children aged 3-6. Our findings suggest that even though AI-based storytelling and reading technologies provide more immersive and engaging interaction, they still cannot meet parents' expectations due to a series of interactive and algorithmic challenges. We elaborate on these challenges and discuss the possible implications of future AI-based interactive storytelling technologies for preschoolers.},

abstract = {The real-world effectiveness of deep neural networks often depends on their latency, thereby necessitating optimization techniques that can reduce a model’s inference time while preserving its performance. One popular approach is to sequentially rewrite the input computation graph into an equivalent but faster one by replacing individual subgraphs. This approach gives rise to the so-called phase-ordering problem in which the application of one rewrite rule can eliminate the possibility to apply an even better one later on. Recent work has shown that equality saturation, a technique from compiler optimization, can mitigate this issue by first building an intermediate representation (IR) that efficiently stores multiple optimized versions of the input program before extracting the best solution in a second step. In practice, however, memory constraints prevent the IR from capturing all optimized versions and thus reintroduce the phase-ordering problem in the construction phase. In this paper, we present a tensor graph rewriting approach that uses Monte Carlo tree search to build superior IRs by identifying the most promising rewrite rules. We also introduce a novel extraction algorithm that can provide fast and accurate runtime estimates of tensor programs represented in an IR. Our approach improves the inference speedup of neural networks by up to 11% compared to existing methods.},

abstract = {Introductory computer science for non-majors, often referred to as CS0, is a course that is designed to be more accessible and less intimidating than CS1, with the goal of alleviating barriers and fears associated with learning computer science (CS). However, despite this intention, many students still struggle in CS0 and these courses do not always successfully prepare students for future CS learning experiences. In this paper, we study the experiences of CS0 students with a particular focus on the intersection of their metacognition, affect, and behaviors. To study students’ daily learning experiences, we collected data from 20 participants who completed structured daily diaries and retrospective interviews over the course of a single homework assignment. Through a thematic analysis of the diaries and interviews, we identified three distinct patterns of engagement that highlight the importance of metacognitive knowledge of strategies, or a students’ understanding of when, why, and how to effectively use regulation and disciplinary strategies while working on tasks. The three patterns of engagement include: (1) avoidance behaviors resulting from negative emotions, negative judgements, and a lack of metacognitive knowledge of strategies, (2) persistence or re-engagement behaviors despite negative emotions and judgements aided by metacognitive knowledge of strategies, and (3) persistence behaviors with evidence that metacognitive knowledge of strategies prevented students from forming negative judgements in the first place. We contribute an initial model of the interplay of metacognition, affect, and behaviors in CS learning, showing the role of metacognitive knowledge of strategies in helping students persist in the face of struggle. In our discussion, we advocate for explicit interventions that support students in developing metacognitive knowledge of strategies while also supporting their sometimes challenging emotional experiences.},

abstract = {Modern Machine Learning (ML) models employ sparsity to mitigate storage and computation costs; but it gives rise to irregular and unstructured sparse matrix operations that dominate the execution time and require specialized accelerators to meet the performance and energy targets. Contemporary sparse matrix accelerators, optimized for extreme sparsity, frequently fall short in addressing the variable and moderate degrees of sparsity prevalent in most ML models. Variable sparsity leads to inefficiency in the storage and processing of matrices. In response to this challenge, we propose an adaptive and generalized architecture design, ZeD, capable of accommodating the variably sparse matrix computations in ML models. Our innovative design integrates a bit-tree compression format and zero-detection hardware, resulting in highly efficient packing, storage, retrieval, and processing of sparse matrices. Furthermore, we propose a matrix row reorganization strategy based on sparsity similarity to substantially enhance memory reuse. Synthesis results of ZeD demonstrate a 3.2 \texttimes{} improvement in performance per area over state-of-the-art solutions across a spectrum of ML workloads characterized by wide-ranging sparsities.},

Using a small finite set of non-deterministic programming constructs (sequencing, non-deterministic choice, and iteration) it is able to express all non-deterministic finite state control flow over a finite set of primitives. It is natural to ask whether there exists a similar finite set of constructs that can capture all deterministic computation. We show that this is not the case. More precisely, the deterministic fragment of KAT is not generated by any finite set of regular control flow operations. This generalizes earlier results about the expressivity of the traditional control flow operations, i.e., sequential composition, if-then-else and while.},

abstract = {Differential computation (DC) has emerged as a powerful general technique for maintaining computations over evolving datasets, even those containing arbitrarily nested loops, making DC particularly well-suited for graph computations. However, the general maintenance technique used by DC makes it less efficient for application-specific workloads. This paper shows how application-specific optimizations can improve both the runtime and memory characteristics of Differential Dataflow (DD), the reference implementation of DC. We present three optimizations for DD that make it more suitable for graph processing. Our first two optimizations are a redesign the in-memory indices that DD uses to maintain operator state, making them more read-friendly and decreasing the amount of data that operators need to scan from the indices. Next, we observe that DD's Reduce operator performs an expensive recomputation to determine whether or not there are any new outputs for changed inputs, even if the outputs have not actually changed. Our third optimization, called Fast Empty Difference Verification, detects when there are no output changes without performing DD's default rerunning logic. We present experiments on a variety of graph computation workloads demonstrating that our optimizations improve DD's runtime by up to 19\texttimes{} and reduce memory consumption by up to 1.7\texttimes{}.},

abstract = {Silicon Dangling Bonds&nbsp;(SiDBs) constitute a beyond-CMOS computational nanotechnology platform that enables higher integration density and lower power consumption than contemporary CMOS nodes. Recent manufacturing breakthroughs in the domain sparked the interest of academia and industry alike in the race for a green computation future at the nanoscale. However, as the fabrication of SiDBs requires atomic precision, SiDB logic systems are inherently susceptible to environmental defects and material variations, which inevitably occur. The Operational Domain is a methodology to evaluate the resilience of SiDB logic against physical parameter variations. However, state-of-the-art implementations require a quadratic number of exponentially complex physical simulator calls to assess the operational domain. This paper presents two novel algorithms to obtain operational domains in an efficient fashion: one based on flood fill, and one based on contour tracing. Experimental evaluations confirm that they reduce the number of required simulator calls by 70.87% and 95.29 %, respectively. Particularly contour tracing achieves the shift from a quadratic to a linear relation, thereby reducing the complexity and paving the way for realizing reliable SiDB-based computing systems.},

abstract = {Repairing bugs can be a daunting task for even a human experienced in debugging, so naturally, attempting to automatically repair programs with a computer system is quite challenging. The existing methods of automated program repair leave a lot of room for improvement. Fault localization, which aims to find lines of code that are potentially buggy, minimises the search space of an automated program repair system. Recent work has shown improvement in these fault localization methods, with the use of Large Language Models. Here, we propose a system where a LLM-based fault localization tool, which we call SemiAutoFL, is used within a fully automatic program repair program, ARJA-e. We show that utilising LLM-based fault localization with ARJA-e can significantly improve its performance on real world bugs. ARJA-e with SemiAutoFL can repair 10 bugs that ARJA-e was previously unable to so do. This finding adds to our understanding of how to improve fault localization and automated program repair, highlighting the potential for more efficient and accurate fault localisation methods being applied to automated program repair.},

abstract = {As graphs exponentially grow recently, out-of-core graph systems have been invented to process large-scale graphs by keeping massive data in storage. Among them, many systems process the graphs iteration-by-iteration and provide synchronous semantics that allows easy programmability by forcing the computation dependency of vertex values between iterations. On the other hand, although future value computation is an effective IO optimization for out-of-core graph systems by computing vertex values of future iterations in advance, it is challenging to take full advantage of future value computation while guaranteeing iteration-based dependency. In fact, based on our investigation, even state-of-the-art work along this direction has a wide gap from optimality in IO reduction and further requires substantial overhead in computation as well as extra memory consumption.This paper presents Grafu, an out-of-core graph system unleashing the full potential of future value computation while providing synchronous semantics. For this goal, three main designs are proposed to optimize future value computation from different perspectives. First, we propose a new elevator execution order to significantly increase the number of future-computed vertices for considerable IO reduction. Second, unlike existing work that uses high-cost barriers to ensure dependency under future value computation, we present conditional barrier to alleviate this computational overhead by adaptively removing the barriers while guaranteeing dependency. Third, we introduce a new graph reordering technique, greedy coloring, to reduce the extra memory consumption required for future value computation. Our evaluation of various billion-scale graphs reveals that Grafu significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {Non-cryptographic (NC) hash functions are crucial in high-speed search applications and probabilistic data structures (PDS) such as Bloom filters and Count-Min sketches for efficient lookups and counting. These operations necessitate execution at line rates to accommodate the high-speed demands of Terabit Ethernet networks, characterized by bandwidths exceeding 100 Gbps. Consequently, a growing inclination towards hardware platforms, particularly Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), is evident in network security applications. Given the centrality of hash functions in these structures, any enhancements to their design carry substantial implications for overall system performance. However, hash functions must exhibit independence, uniform distribution, and hardware-friendly characteristics. In this work, we employ Genetic Programming (GP) with avalanche metrics as a fitness function to devise a hardware-friendly family of NC hash functions called the Evolutionary hash (E-hash). We provide a detailed experimental analysis to offer insights on primitive set combinations involving logical operations and diverse hyperparameter settings, encompassing variables such as the number of nodes, tree height, population size, crossover and mutation rate, tournament size, number of constants, and generations. Compared to existing state-of-the-art hardware-friendly hash functions, the proposed E-hash family exhibits an 8.4% improvement in terms of operating frequency and throughput and 7.74% in latency on FPGA.},

While prior work documented many of these concerns and hopes, a better understanding of how parents prioritize these considerations with respect to one another could help design technologies for children that better address parents’ needs. We constructed a set of statements based on existing literature. 49 parents of 3-8-year-old children completed a Q-sort activity with these statements, from which we developed three parent personas with distinct attitudes toward technologies aimed at children. We contribute the item set, parent suggestions for additional items, three parent personas, and initial persona validation through a focus group study. We discuss how researchers could 1) use these personas to check for missing perspectives or as aids in participatory design work and 2) use the Q-sort method to create personas based on other populations and contexts.},

However, the game design process has been mostly limited to professionals, often resulting in games that may not align with children’s interests. Involving children in the design process allows them to express their interests and values and exercise skills like decision-making and organization. A Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) was conducted to explore research on the design and specification of games involving the participation of children. The SMS served as the basis of the development of a methodology for designing educational games for deaf children, involving game developers, teachers, and the children themselves. The SMS provided insights into game design sessions, including their structure, duration, and activities. The review also offered recommendations on conducting such sessions and highlighted the benefits and challenges associated with involving children in game design.},

abstract = {Storage disaggregation underlies today's cloud and is naturally complemented by pushing down some computation to storage, thus mitigating the potential network bottleneck between the storage and compute tiers. We show how ML training benefits from storage pushdowns by focusing on transfer learning (TL), the widespread technique that democratizes ML by reusing existing knowledge on related tasks. We propose HAPI, a new TL processing system centered around two complementary techniques that address challenges introduced by disaggregation. First, applications must carefully balance execution across tiers for performance. HAPI judiciously splits the TL computation during the feature extraction phase yielding pushdowns that not only improve network time but also improve total TL training time by overlapping the execution of consecutive training iterations across tiers. Second, operators want resource efficiency from the storage-side computational resources. HAPI employs storage-side batch size adaptation allowing increased storage-side pushdown concurrency without affecting training accuracy. HAPI yields up to 2.5\texttimes{} training speed-up while choosing in 86.8% of cases the best performing split point or one that is at most 5% off from the best.},

However, many CS programs lack accessibility coverage, often confining it to human-computer interaction (HCI) courses. To address this gap, we developed accessibility assignments seamlessly integrated into core CS courses. We collaborated closely with ten instructors to select and customize these assignments to suit their needs. To evaluate the impact of these assignments, we conducted interviews with instructors and administered surveys and interviews with their students. Our findings indicate significant improvement in students' familiarity with accessibility concepts and confidence in implementation following completion of the assignments. However, their mindset and future interest in accessibility remained the same. Instructors found it straightforward to incorporate these assignments without compromising core computing concepts. In sum, we validated a foundation for effectively resourcing instructors with accessibility teaching materials and increasing their capacity in accessibility knowledge.},

For this, it was necessary to study and understand the design and development process of an educational digital game, evaluating the playful and pedagogical elements that could be used. The work methodology was structured in three stages: 1) game design, 2) application of the game to the research participants, and; 3) data collection and analysis. The main perceptions of the participants about the game, the obstacles and facilitators during the gameplay, and the possible contributions in relation to the design and development of the game were analyzed. The results showed that game-based learning is promising and innovative, as it encourages students’ interest and motivation about the themes through resources beyond the classroom space.},

abstract = {A growing number of long non-coding RNAs have been found to be associated with various diseases, highlighting the significance of predicting lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) for disease diagnosis and treatment. In light of the time-consuming and laborious nature of traditional biological experiments, numerous algorithms have been developed to predict unknown LDAs. To predict potential LDAs, we propose a model called GMF-MGCN-LDA, that leverages the advantages of graph convolutional networks and generalized matrix factorization. Firstly, in order to extract high-order nonlinear feature of lncRNA and disease, the hypergraph regularization term is introduced into the generalized matrix factorization framework to learn latent feature of lncRNA and disease. Next, in order to enrich the feature of lncRNA and disease, the graph convolutional networks is employed to learn nonlinear features from diverse similarity graph views, followed by the attention mechanism that adaptively assigns weights to these features. Finally, the convolutional neural networks is utilized to integrate features from each view. The features learned by generalized matrix factorization and convolutional neural networks are concatenated to obtain the final lncRNA and disease feature. Based on known LDAs, the two final features are further concatenated and merged into one feature as input to the CatBoost classifier to output the predicted association probability of lncRNA-disease pairs. The experimental results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the components in GMF-MGCN-LDA but also establish its performance is better than or comparable to other models. Furthermore, the case study underscores the model's reliable prediction capability.},

However, we have little guidance on how these framings may manifest in classroom practice.Objectives: To better understand the processes and practice of critical pedagogy in a computing classrooms, we taught a critically conscious computing elective within a summer academic program at a northwest United States university targeted at secondary students (ages 14–18) from low-income backgrounds and would be the first in their families to pursue a post-secondary education (i.e., first-generation). We investigated: (1) our participants’ initial perceptions of and attitudes toward the benefits and perils of computing, and (2) potential tensions that might emerge when secondary students negotiate the integration of critical pedagogy in a computing classroom.Methods: We qualitatively coded participant work from a critically conscious computing course within a summer academic program in the United States focused on students from low-income backgrounds or would be the first in their family to pursue a post-secondary education.Findings: Our participants’ initial attitudes toward technology were mostly positive, but exhibited an awareness of its negative impacts on their lives and society. Throughout the course, while participants demonstrated a rich social consciousness around technology, they faced challenges in addressing hegemonic values embedded in their programs, designs, and other classwork.Implications: Our findings revealed tensions between our participants’ computing attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, and social consciousness, suggesting pathways for scaffolding the critical examination of technology in secondary education. This study provides insights into the pedagogical content knowledge necessary for critical computing education.},

We assume there are n parties and the adversary corrupts t of them, where 2t &lt; n. In this work, we leverage RMFEs (Reverse Multiplication Friendly Embeddings) to build an MPC protocol over Zpk with constant online communication. An (l, d)-RMFE packs l elements from Zpk into an element in GR(pk, d) = Zpk [X]/h(X), where deg h = d. The existence of asymptotically good RMFE ensures that d/l is bounded by a constant independent of n.We show that the method from Turbopack applies to honest majority secure multiparty computation over Zpk in the preprocessing model, achieving perfect security and the best online communication complexity. In the semi-honest setting, we build a secure multiparty computation protocol over Zpk based on the packed Shamir secret-sharing over an extension ring and RMFEs. The online communication requires 12d/l elements per multiplication gate. The communication cost per multiplication gate in the preprocessing phase is Θ(n log n). This is the first protocol over Zpk such that an arithmetic circuit can be evaluated with overall communication complexity O(1) elements per multiplication gate.},

Given the diversity of sparse matrices, designing a tailored program for each matrix is challenging. To address this, we propose SRSparse1 an program generator that creates tailored programs by automatically combining program designing methods to fit specific input matrices. It provides two components: the problem definition configuration, which declares the computation, and the scheduling language, which can be leveraged by an auto-tuner to specify the program designs. The two are lowered to the intermediate representations of SRSparse, the Format IR and Kernel IR, which respectively generates format conversion routine and kernel code. We evaluate SRSparse on four representative sparse kernels and three format conversion routines. For sparse kernels, SRSparse achieves median speedups over handwritten programs: COO (3.50 \texttimes{}), CSR-Adaptive (5.36 \texttimes{}), CSR5 (2.06 \texttimes{}), ELL (1.63 \texttimes{}), Gunrock (1.57 \texttimes{}), and GraphBLAST (1.96 \texttimes{}); over an auto-tuner: AlphaSparse (1.16 \texttimes{}); and over a compiler: TACO (1.71 \texttimes{}).

a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. To date, MPC 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
has been widely adopted in various real-world, privacy-sensitive sectors, such 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as healthcare and finance. Moreover, to ease the adoption of MPC, industrial and academic 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MPC compilers have been developed to automatically translate 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
programs describing arbitrary MPC procedures into low-level MPC executables. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Compiling high-level descriptions into high-efficiency MPC executables is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
challenging: the compilation often involves converting high-level languages into 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
several intermediate representations (IR), e.g., arithmetic or boolean circuits, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
optimizing the computation/communication cost, and picking proper MPC protocols (and

Despite the prosperous adoption of MPC compilers by industrial vendors and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
academia, a principled and systematic understanding of the correctness of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MPC compilers does not yet exist. To fill this critical gap, this paper 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
introduces MT-MPC, a metamorphic testing (MT) framework specifically designed for 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MPC compilers to effectively uncover erroneous compilations. Our approach 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
proposes three metamorphic relations (MRs) that are tailored for MPC programs to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mutate high-level MPC programs (compiler inputs). We then examine if MPC 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compilers yield semantics-equivalent MPC executables regarding the original and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mutated MPC programs by comparing their execution results. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Real-world MPC compilers exhibit a high level of engineering quality. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nevertheless, we detected 4,772 inputs that can result in erroneous 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compilations in three popular MPC compilers available on the market. While the 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discovered error-triggering inputs do not cause the MPC compilers to crash

abstract = {Bit-serial Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is an attractive paradigm for accelerator architectures, for parallel workloads such as Deep Learning (DL), because of its capability to achieve massive data parallelism at a low area overhead and provide orders-of-magnitude data movement savings by moving computational resources closer to the data. While many PIM architectures have been proposed, improvements are needed in communicating intermediate results to consumer kernels, for communication between tiles at scale, for reduction operations, and for efficiently performing bit-serial operations with constants. We present PIMSAB, a scalable architecture that provides a spatially aware communication network for efficient intra-tile and inter-tile data movement and provides efficient computation support for generally inefficient bit-serial compute patterns. Our architecture consists of a massive hierarchical array of compute-enabled SRAMs (CRAMs), which is codesigned with a compiler to achieve high utilization. The key novelties of our architecture are (1) in providing efficient support for spatially aware communication by providing local H-tree network for reductions, by adding explicit hardware for shuffling operands, and by deploying systolic broadcasting, as well as (2) by taking advantage of the divisible nature of bit-serial computations through adaptive precision and efficient handling of constant operations. These innovations are integrated into a tensor expressions-based programming framework (including a compiler for easy programmability) that enables simple programmer control of optimizations for mapping programs into massively parallel binaries for millions of PIM processing elements. When compared against a similarly provisioned modern Tensor Core GPU (NVIDIA A100), across common DL kernels and end-to-end DL networks (Resnet18 and BERT), PIMSAB outperforms the GPU by 4.80\texttimes{}, and reduces energy by 3.76\texttimes{}. We compare PIMSAB with similarly provisioned state-of-the-art SRAM PIM (Duality Cache) and DRAM PIM (SIMDRAM), and observe a speedup of 3.7\texttimes{} and 3.88\texttimes{}, respectively.},

abstract = {Uniform Interpolation (UI) is an advanced reasoning service used to narrow down an ontology to a restricted view. This new ontology, known as a uniform interpolant, will only consist of the ''relevant names'', yet it will retain their original meanings. UI is immensely promising due to its applicability across various domains where custom views of ontologies are essential. Nonetheless, to unlock its full potential, we need optimized techniques to generate these tailored views. Previous studies suggest that creating uniform interpolants for EL-ontologies is notably challenging. In some instances, it is not even feasible to compute a uniform interpolant; when feasible, the size of the uniform interpolant can be up to triple exponentially larger than the source ontology. Despite these challenges, our paper introduces an improved ''forgetting'' technique specifically designed for computing uniform interpolants of ELI-ontologies. We demonstrate that, with good normalization and inference strategies, such uniform interpolants can be efficiently computed, just as quickly as computing ''modules''. A comprehensive evaluation with a prototypical implementation of the method shows superb success rates over two popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating a clear computational advantage over state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {There has been growing interest in developing ubiquitous technologies to analyze adult-child speech in naturalistic settings such as free play in order to support children's social and academic development, language acquisition, and parent-child interactions. However, these technologies often rely on off-the-shelf speech processing tools that have not been evaluated on child speech or child-directed adult speech, whose unique characteristics might result in significant performance gaps when using models trained on adult speech. This work introduces the Playlogue dataset containing over 33 hours of long-form, naturalistic, play-based adult-child conversations from three different corpora of preschool-aged children. Playlogue enables researchers to train and evaluate speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition models on child-centered speech. We demonstrate the lack of generalizability of existing state-of-the-art models when evaluated on Playlogue, and show how fine-tuning models on adult-child speech mitigates the performance gap to some extent but still leaves considerable room for improvement. We further annotate over 5 hours of the Playlogue dataset with 8668 validated adult and child speech act labels, which can be used to train and evaluate models to provide clinically relevant feedback on parent-child interactions. We investigate the performance of state-of-the-art language models at automatically predicting these speech act labels, achieving significant accuracy with simple chain-of-thought prompting or minimal fine-tuning. We use inhome pilot data to validate the generalizability of models trained on Playlogue, demonstrating its utility in improving speech and language technologies for child-centered conversations.

In this context, we explore AI as a tool that mediates cultural understanding and remediates human values – that are often influenced by biases and inequities. Using participatory design for learning with a group of 13 children (ages 8-13), we engaged in five co-design sessions featuring different modalities for socio-cultural approaches to AI literacy. We found that children were more aware of the cultural mediation aspect of AI when the content of the interaction aligned with their cultural background and context. This underscored the significance of aligning the representation of culture in these GenAI systems with people’s socio-cultural ecosystems in modern technological literacies. We conclude with design principles for a more critical and holistic approach to AI literacy.},

abstract = {Buss et al [KDD 2020] recently proved that the problem of computing the betweenness of all nodes of a temporal graph is computationally hard in the case of foremost and fastest paths, while it is solvable in time O(n3T2) in the case of shortest and shortest foremost paths, where n is the number of nodes and T is the number of distinct time steps. A new algorithm for temporal betweenness computation is introduced in this paper. In the case of shortest and shortest foremost paths, it requires O(n + M) space and runs in time O(nM)=O(n3T), where M is the number of temporal edges, thus significantly improving the algorithm of Buss et al in terms of time complexity (note that T is usually large). Experimental evidence is provided that our algorithm performs between twice and almost 250 times better than the algorithm of Buss et al. Moreover, we were able to compute the exact temporal betweenness values of several large temporal graphs with over a million of temporal edges. For such size, only approximate computation was possible by using the algorithm of Santoro and Sarpe [WWW 2022]. Maybe more importantly, our algorithm extends to the case of restless walks (that is, walks with waiting constraints in each node), thus providing a polynomial-time algorithm (with complexity O(nM)) for computing the temporal betweenness in the case of several different optimality criteria. Such restless computation was known only for the shortest criterion (Rymar et al [JGAA 2023]), with complexity O(n2MT2). We performed an extensive experimental validation by comparing different waiting constraints and different optimisation criteria. Moreover, as a case study, we investigate six public transit networks including Berlin, Rome, and Paris. Overall we find a general consistency between the different variants of betweenness centrality. However, we do measure a sensible influence of waiting constraints, and note some cases of low correlation for certain pairs of criteria in some networks.},

abstract = {Sparse Matrix-matrix Multiplication (SpMM) and Sampled Dense-dense Matrix Multiplication (SDDMM) are important sparse operators in scientific computing and deep learning. Tensor Core Units (TCUs) enhance modern accelerators with superior computing power, which is promising to boost the performance of matrix operators to a higher level. However, due to the irregularity of unstructured sparse data, it is difficult to deliver practical speedups on TCUs. To this end, we propose FlashSparse, a novel approach to bridge the gap between sparse workloads and the TCU architecture. Specifically, FlashSparse minimizes the sparse granularity for SpMM and SDDMM on TCUs through a novel swap-and-transpose matrix multiplication strategy. Benefiting from the minimum sparse granularity, the computation redundancy is remarkably reduced while the computing power of TCUs is fully utilized. Besides, FlashSparse is equipped with a memory-efficient thread mapping strategy for coalesced data access and a sparse matrix storage format to save memory footprint. Extensive experimental results on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs show that FlashSparse sets a new state-of-the-art for sparse matrix multiplications (geometric mean 5.5x speedup over DTC-SpMM and 3.22x speedup over RoDe).},

According to different coordination modes, each layer of CAVs is divided, and the problem of delay optimization is classified in fine granularity.

abstract = {The advent of Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) has enabled service providers to mitigate high network latencies often encountered in accessing cloud services. The key idea of MEC involves service providers deploying containerized application services on MEC servers situated near Internet-of-Things (IoT) device users. The users access these services via wireless base stations with ultra low latency. Computation tasks of IoT devices can then either be executed locally on the devices or on the MEC servers. A key cornerstone of the MEC environment is an offloading policy utilized to determine whether to execute computation tasks on IoT devices or to offload the tasks to MEC servers for processing. In this work, we propose a two phase Probabilistic Model Checking based offloading policy catering to IoT device user preferences. The first stage evaluates the trade-offs between local vs server execution while the second stage evaluates the trade-offs between choice of wireless communication bands for offloaded tasks. We present experimental results in practical scenarios on data gathered from an IoT test-bed setup with benchmark applications to show the benefits of an adaptive preference-aware approach over conventional approaches in the MEC offloading context.},

This paper shows how to generate asymptotically better schedules for complex sparse tensor expressions using kernel fission and fusion. We present generalized loop restructuring transformations to reduce asymptotic time complexity and memory footprint.
 
 
 
Furthermore, we present an auto-scheduler that uses a partially ordered set (poset)-based cost model that uses both time and auxiliary memory complexities to prune the search space of schedules. In addition, we highlight the use of Satisfiability Module Theory (SMT) solvers in sparse auto-schedulers to approximate the Pareto frontier of better schedules to the smallest number of possible schedules, with user-defined constraints available at compile-time. Finally, we show that our auto-scheduler can select better-performing schedules and generate code for them. Our results show that the auto-scheduler provided schedules achieve orders-of-magnitude speedup compared to the code generated by the Tensor Algebra Compiler (TACO) for several computations on different real-world tensors.},

We evaluated on two human computation puzzle tasks, and found the impact varied based on task; the quality-diversity tools appeared to help more in the travelling salesperson task, while collaboration appeared to help more in the knapsack task.},

In this article, we first establish a connection between the two quantities, representing  (mathcal{K})  in terms of  (H_{j})  for all vertices. We then develop an efficient algorithm estimating  (H_{j})  for all vertices and  (mathcal{K})  in nearly linear time of  (m) . Moreover, we extend the centrality  (H_{j})  of a single vertex to  (H(S))  of a vertex set  (S) , and establish a link between  (H(S))  and some other quantities. We further study the NP-hard problem of selecting a group  (S)  of  (kll n)  vertices with minimum  (H(S)) , whose objective function is monotonic and supermodular. We finally propose two greedy algorithms approximately solving the problem.

abstract = {The key assumption underlying linear Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is that the learner has access to a known feature map φ(x, a) that maps state-action pairs to d-dimensional vectors, and that the rewards and transition probabilities are linear functions in this representation. But where do these features come from? In the absence of expert domain knowledge, a tempting strategy is to use the “kitchen sink” approach and hope that the true features are included in a much larger set of potential features. In this paper we revisit linear MDPs from the perspective of feature selection. In a k-sparse linear MDP, there is an unknown subset S ⊂ [d] of size k containing all the relevant features, and the goal is to learn a near-optimal policy in only poly(k,logd) interactions with the environment. Our main result is the first polynomial-time algorithm for this problem. In contrast, earlier works either made prohibitively strong assumptions that obviated the need for exploration, or required solving computationally intractable optimization problems.   Along the way we introduce the notion of an emulator: a succinct approximate representation of the transitions, that still suffices for computing certain Bellman backups. Since linear MDPs are a non-parametric model, it is not even obvious whether polynomial-sized emulators exist. We show that they do exist, and moreover can be computed efficiently via convex programming.   As a corollary of our main result, we give an algorithm for learning a near-optimal policy in block MDPs whose decoding function is a low-depth decision tree; the algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time and takes a polynomial number of samples (in the size of the decision tree). This can be seen as a reinforcement learning analogue of classic results in computational learning theory. Furthermore, it gives a natural model where improving the sample complexity via representation learning is computationally feasible.},

One challenge when writing such functions is that most MPC languages force users to intermix programmatic and privacy concerns in a single application, making it difficult to change or audit a program's underlying privacy policy. Prior policy-agnostic MPC languages relied on dynamic enforcement to decouple privacy requirements from program logic. Unfortunately, the resulting overhead makes it difficult to scale MPC applications that manipulate structured data. This work proposes to eliminate this overhead by instead transforming programs into semantically equivalent versions that statically enforce user-provided privacy policies. We have implemented this approach in a new MPC language, called Taypsi; our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the resulting system features considerable performance improvements on a variety of MPC applications involving structured data and complex privacy policies.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a problem of index maintenance on evolving graphs for effective resistance computation. Unlike an existing matrices-based index, we show that the index can be efficiently maintained by directly preserving samples of random walks and loop-erased walks. This approach not only enables efficient storage and rapid query response but also supports effective maintenance. We propose a novel approach to convert edge updates into landmark node updates. Building upon this, we present two new update algorithms for random walk and loop-erased walk samples respectively. Both algorithms update samples without requiring complete resampling, ensuring accuracy and high efficiency. A particularly challenging and innovative technique involves updating loop-erased walks. Here we develop a novel and powerful cycle decomposition technique for loop-erased walks, enabling us to update samples at the cycle level rather than the node level, significantly enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, we show that both of our methods achieve an \~{O} (1) time complexity per edge update in real-world graphs under a mild assumption. We conduct extensive experiments using 10 large real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our approaches. The results show that our best algorithm can be up to two orders of magnitude faster than the baseline methods.},

It is of paramount importance to efficiently perform out-of-core computations that often entail an excessive amount of disk I/O. Unfortunately, however, most existing systems do not focus on disk I/O aspects and are vulnerable to performance degradation when the scale of input matrices and intermediate data grows large. To address this problem, we present a new out-of-core matrix computation system called PreVision. The PreVision system can achieve optimal buffer replacement by leveraging the deterministic characteristics of data access patterns, and it can also avoid redundant I/O operations by proactively evicting the pages that are no longer referenced. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PreVision outperforms the existing out-of-core matrix computation systems and significantly reduces disk I/O operations.},

abstract = {Oblivious RAM (ORAM) allows a client to securely outsource memory storage to an untrusted server. It has been shown that no ORAM can simultaneously achieve small bandwidth blow-up, small client storage, and a single roundtrip of latency.We consider a weakening of the RAM model, which we call the Single Access Machine (SAM) model. In the SAM model, each memory slot can be written to at most once and read from at most once. We adapt existing tree-based ORAM to obtain an oblivious SAM (OSAM) that has O(log n) bandwidth blow-up (which we show is optimal), small client storage, and a single roundtrip.OSAM unlocks improvements to oblivious data structures/algorithms. For instance, we achieve oblivious unbalanced binary trees (e.g. tries, splay trees). By leveraging splay trees, we obtain a notion of caching ORAM, where an access in the worst case incurs amortized O(log2 n) bandwidth blow-up and O(log n) roundtrips, but in many common cases (e.g. sequential scans) incurs only amortized O(log n) bandwidth blow-up and O(1) roundtrips. We also give new oblivious graph algorithms, including computing minimum spanning trees and single source shortest paths, in which the OSAM client reads/writes O(|E| ⋅ log |E|) words using O(|E|) roundtrips, where |E| is the number of edges. This improves over prior custom solutions by a log factor.At a higher level, OSAM provides a general model for oblivious computation. We construct a programming interface around OSAM that supports arbitrary pointer-manipulating programs such that dereferencing a pointer to an object incurs O(log d log n) bandwidth blowup and O(log d) roundtrips, where d is the number of pointers to that object. This new interface captures a wide variety of data structures and algorithms (e.g., trees, tries, doubly-linked lists) while matching or exceeding prior best asymptotic results. It both unifies much of our understanding of oblivious computation and allows the programmer to write oblivious algorithms combining various common data structures/algorithms and beyond.},

Unlike trustless blockchains, e-cash designs inherently rely on a trusted party with full control over the currency supply. Since this trusted component cannot be eliminated from the system, we aim to minimize the trust it requires. We approach this goal from two angles. Firstly, we employ misuse-resistant hardware to mitigate the risk of compromise via physical access to the trusted device. Secondly, we divide the trusted device’s capabilities among multiple independent devices, in a way that ensures unforgeability of its currency as long as at least a single device remains uncompromised. Finally, we combine both these approaches to leverage their complementary benefits. In particular, we surveyed blind protocols used in e-cash designs with the goal of identifying those suitable for misuse-resistant, yet resource-constrained devices. Based on the survey, we focused on the BDHKE-based construction suitable for the implementation on devices with limited resources. Next, we proposed a new multi-party protocol for distributing the operations needed in BDHKE-based e-cash and analyzed its security. Finally, we implemented the protocol for the JavaCard platform and demonstrated the practicality of the approach by measuring its performance on a physical smartcard.},

abstract = {This demonstration presents a new Open Source SQL-to-SQL compiler for Incremental View Maintenance (IVM). While previous systems, such as DBToaster, implemented computational functionality for IVM in a separate system, the core principle of OpenIVM is to make use of existing SQL query processing engines and perform all IVM computations via SQL. This approach enables the integration of IVM in these systems without code duplication. Also, it eases its use in cross-system IVM, i.e. to orchestrate an HTAP system in which one (OLTP) DBMS provides insertions/updates/deletes (deltas), which are propagated using SQL into another (OLAP) DBMS, hosting materialized views. Our system compiles view definitions into SQL to eventually propagate deltas into the table that materializes the view, following the principles of DBSP.Under the hood, OpenIVM uses the DuckDB library to compile (parse, transform, optimize) the materialized view maintenance logic. We demonstrate OpenIVM in action (i) as the core of a DuckDB extension module that adds IVM functionality to it and (ii) powering cross-system IVM for HTAP, with PostgreSQL handling updates on base tables and DuckDB hosting materialized views on these.},

Yet, existing hardware, such as Tensor Cores (TC), is ill-suited for SpMM, as it imposes strict constraints on data structures that cannot be met by unstructured sparsity found in many applications. To address this, we introduce (S)parse (Ma)trix Matrix (T)ensor Core-accelerated (SMaT): a novel SpMM library that utilizes TCs for unstructured sparse matrices. Our block-sparse library leverages the low-level CUDA MMA (matrix-matrix-accumulate) API, maximizing the performance offered by modern GPUs. Algorithmic optimizations such as sparse matrix permutation, further improve performance by minimizing the number of non-zero blocks. The evaluation on NVIDIA A100 shows that SMaT outperforms SotA libraries (DASP, cuSPARSE, and Magicube) by up to 125x (on average 2.6x). SMaT can be used to accelerate many workloads in scientific computing, large model training, inference, and others.},

abstract = {Bessel functions are critical in scientific computing for applications such as machine learning, protein structure modeling, and robotics. However, currently, available routines lack precision or fail for certain input ranges, such as when the order v is large, and GPU-specific implementations are limited. We address the precision limitations of current numerical implementations while dramatically improving the runtime. We propose two novel algorithms for computing the logarithm of modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds by computing intermediate values on a logarithmic scale. Our algorithms are robust and never have issues with underflows or overflows while having relative errors on the order of machine precision, even for inputs where existing libraries fail. In C++/CUDA, our algorithms have median and maximum speedups of 45x and 6150x for GPU and 17x and 3403x for CPU, respectively, over the ranges of inputs and third-party libraries tested. Compared to SciPy, the algorithms have median and maximum speedups of 77x and 300x for GPU and 35x and 98x for CPU, respectively, over the ranges of inputs tested. The ability to robustly compute a solution and the low relative errors allow us to fit von Mises-Fisher, vMF, distributions to high-dimensional neural network features. This is, e.g., relevant for uncertainty quantification in metric learning. We obtain image feature data by processing CIFAR10 training images with the convolutional layers of a pre-trained ResNet50. We successfully fit vMF distributions to 2048-, 8192-, and 32768-dimensional image feature data using our algorithms. Our approach provides fast and accurate results while existing implementations in the Python libraries SciPy and mpmath fail to fit successfully. Our approach is readily implementable on GPUs, and we provide a fast open-source implementation alongside this paper.},

abstract = {Typically, in a cyber-physical system (CPS), timing jitters between sensing and actuation adversely affect its physical behavior. Logical execution time (LET) paradigm has gained industry attention because it offers zero jitters in tasks’ response time. In autonomous CPS such as self-driving cars, Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is becoming a popular software platform to implement computation tasks. Towards a practical LET implementation of ROS2 computation chains, we propose to use at least two table-driven reservation servers: (i)&nbsp;one exclusively runs the processor thread that publishes the chain’s output while (ii)&nbsp;others isolate the chain’s main computations from best-effort workloads on the same processing unit. We show how to architecturally adapt the chain non-intrusively as well as dimension the servers and allocate appropriate threads to them so that we obtain negligible jitters while keeping the observed maximum end-to-end latency comparable to a high-priority execution of the chain. Also, our approach is versatile and can produce latency bands, thereby offering an opportunity to co-optimize jitters and average end-to-end latency. This further supports multi-mode application design, which is especially important for a high-performance operation in different environments, e.g., city and highway driving. Our idea does not involve modification or recompilation of the application code or ROS2 libraries, which is crucial in industry settings. We have also developed tools to automate our approach. By applying our proposed mechanism on a real-world benchmark implementing Lidar-based localization, we maintain a constant end-to-end latency that is even 13% shorter than an improved LET implementation.},

abstract = {To speed up computation, deep neural networks (DNNs) usually rely on highly optimized tensor operators. Despite the effectiveness, tensor operators are often defined empirically with ad hoc semantics. This hinders the analysis and optimization across operator boundaries. FractalTensor is a programming framework that addresses this challenge. At the core, FractalTensor is a nested list-based abstract data type (ADT), where each element is a tensor with static shape or another FractalTensor (i.e., nested). DNNs are then de-fined by high-order array compute operators like map/reduce/scan and array access operators like window/stride on FractalTensor. This new way of DNN definition explicitly exposes nested data parallelism and fine-grained data access patterns, opening new opportunities for whole program analysis and optimization. To exploit these opportunities, from the FractalTensor-based code the compiler extracts a nested multi-dimensional dataflow graph called Extended Task Dependence Graph (ETDG), which provides a holistic view of data dependency across different granularity. The ETDG is then transformed into an efficient implementation through graph coarsening, data reordering, and access materialization. Evaluation on six representative DNNs like RNN and FlashAttention on NVIDIA A100 shows that Fractal-Tensor achieves speedup by up to 5.45x and 2.14x on average through a unified solution for diverse optimizations.},

abstract = {We initiate the study of graph algorithms in the streaming setting on massive distributed and parallel systems inspired by practical data processing systems. The objective is to design algorithms that can efficiently process evolving graphs via large batches of edge insertions and deletions using as little memory as possible.We focus on the nowadays canonical model for the study of theoretical algorithms for massive networks, the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model. We design MPC algorithms that efficiently process evolving graphs: in a constant number of rounds they can handle large batches of edge updates for problems such as connectivity, minimum spanning forest, and approximate matching while adhering to the most restrictive memory regime, in which the local memory per machine is strongly sublinear in the number of vertices and the total memory is sublinear in the graph size. These results improve upon earlier works in this area which rely on using larger total space, proportional to the size of the processed graph. Our work demonstrates that parallel algorithms can process dynamically changing graphs with asymptotically optimal utilization of MPC resources: parallel time, local memory, and total memory, while processing large batches of edge updates.},

abstract = {This paper presents the formulation and implementation of a high performance algorithm to compute the many-body electronic correlation energy via the random-phase approximation within density functional theory. Our approach circumvents computational inefficiencies inherent in direct approaches which exhibit quartic scaling with respect to system size. Our formulation requires solving block linear systems whose coefficient matrices are complex symmetric; these systems are of widely-varying numerical difficulty. We develop a short-term recurrence block Krylov subspace solver for these systems and leverage a dynamic block size selection to mitigate load imbalances. This selection balances the increased cost per linear solver iteration with a reduction in the number of iterations for slowly-converging systems. Numerical experiments show that our implementation exhibits good parallel scalability, achieves faster solution times than direct approaches on even the smallest chemical system tested, and scales to larger systems and processor counts due to its cubic scaling and greater computational locality.},

abstract = {The arboricity a(G) of a graph G is defined as the minimum number of edge-disjoint forests that the edge set of G can be partitioned into. It is a fundamental metric and has been widely used in many graph analysis applications. However, computing a(G) is typically a challenging task. To address this, an easier-to-compute alternative called pseudoarboricity was proposed. Pseudoarboricity has been shown to be closely connected to many important measures in graphs, including the arboricity and the densest subgraph density ρ(G). Computing the exact pseudoarboricity can be achieved by employing a parametric max-flow algorithm, but it becomes computationally expensive for large graphs. Existing 2-approximation algorithms, while more efficient, often lack satisfactory approximation accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose two new approximation algorithms with theoretical guarantees to approximate the pseudoarboricity. We show that our approximation algorithms can significantly reduce the number of times the max-flow algorithm is invoked, greatly improving its efficiency for exact pseudoarboricity computation. In addition, we also study the pseudoarboricity maintenance problem in dynamic graphs. We propose two novel and efficient algorithms for maintaining the pseudoarboricity when the graph is updated by edge insertions or deletions. Furthermore, we develop two incremental pseudoarboricity maintenance algorithms specifically designed for insertion-only scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on 195 real-world graphs, and the results demonstrate the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms in computing pseudoarboricity for both static and dynamic graphs.},

abstract = {Computation-in-memory (CIM) is a promising solution to tackle the memory wall problem in big data and artificial intelligence applications. One possible approach to implement such a scheme is to use nonvolatile resistive memory technologies like spin transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) or resistive RAM (ReRAM). However, despite all the attractive features these technologies offer, they introduce new types of defects different from conventional SRAM technologies. Therefore, there is a need for dedicated testing algorithms that can detect such defects. In this paper, we proposed a testing scheme for CIM-capable memories that utilizes trim circuitry to dynamically switch between standard memory testing and CIM testing modes based on the speed and accuracy requirements, eliminating unnecessary testing overheads. This feature provides significant test time reduction while preserving the quality of the test. The proposed method is compatible with existing memory built-in self-test (MBIST) architecture and can be used for different types of emerging resistive memory technologies.},

abstract = {Numerous quantum algorithms require the use of quantum error correction to overcome the intrinsic unreliability of physical qubits. However, quantum error correction imposes a unique performance bottleneck, known as T-complexity, that can make an implementation of an algorithm as a quantum program run more slowly than on idealized hardware. In this work, we identify that programming abstractions for control flow, such as the quantum if-statement, can introduce polynomial increases in the T-complexity of a program. If not mitigated, this slowdown can diminish the computational advantage of a quantum algorithm. To enable reasoning about the costs of control flow, we present a cost model that a developer can use to accurately analyze the T-complexity of a program under quantum error correction and pinpoint the sources of slowdown. To enable the mitigation of these costs, we present a set of program-level optimizations that a developer can use to rewrite a program to reduce its T-complexity, predict the T-complexity of the optimized program using the cost model, and then compile it to an efficient circuit via a straightforward strategy. We implement the program-level optimizations in Spire, an extension of the Tower quantum compiler. Using a set of 11 benchmark programs that use control flow, we empirically show that the cost model is accurate, and that Spire’s optimizations recover programs that are asymptotically efficient, meaning their runtime T-complexity under error correction is equal to their time complexity on idealized hardware. Our results show that optimizing a program before it is compiled to a circuit can yield better results than compiling the program to an inefficient circuit and then invoking a quantum circuit optimizer found in prior work. For our benchmarks, only 2 of 8 tested quantum circuit optimizers recover circuits with asymptotically efficient T-complexity. Compared to these 2 optimizers, Spire uses 54\texttimes{}–2400\texttimes{} less compile time.},

abstract = {As AI chips incorporate numerous parallelized cores to scale deep learning (DL) computing, inter-core communication is enabled recently by employing high-bandwidth and low-latency interconnect links on the chip (e.g., Graphcore IPU). It allows each core to directly access the fast scratchpad memory in other cores, which enables new parallel computing paradigms. However, without proper support for the scalable inter-core connections in current DL compilers, it is hard for developers to exploit the benefits of this new architecture.We present T10, the first DL compiler to exploit the inter-core communication bandwidth and distributed on-chip memory on AI chips. To formulate the computation and communication patterns of tensor operators in this new architecture, T10 introduces a distributed tensor abstraction rTensor. T10 maps a DNN model to execution plans with a generalized compute-shift pattern, by partitioning DNN computation into sub-operators and mapping them to cores, so that the cores can exchange data following predictable patterns. T10 makes globally optimized trade-offs between on-chip memory consumption and inter-core communication overhead, selects the best execution plan from a vast optimization space, and alleviates unnecessary inter-core communications. Our evaluation with a real inter-core connected AI chip, the Graphcore IPU, shows up to 3.3\texttimes{} performance improvement, and scalability support for larger models, compared to state-of-the-art DL compilers and vendor libraries.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable ability throughout the field of computer vision. However, CNN inference requires a large number of arithmetic operations making them expensive to deploy in hardware. Current approaches alleviate this issue by developing hardware-supported, algorithmic processes to simplify spatial convolution functions. However, these methods still heavily rely on matrix multiplication, leading to significant computational overhead. To bridge the gap between hardware, algorithmic acceleration, and approximate matrix multiplication, we propose TabConv, a novel, table-based approximation for convolution to significantly reduce arithmetic operations during inference. Additionally, we introduce a priority masking technique based on cosine similarity to select layers for table-based approximation, thereby maintaining the model performance. We evaluate our approach on popular CNNs: ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and NetworkIn-Network (NIN). TabConv preserves over 93% of the original model's performance while reducing arithmetic operations by 36.5%, 25.8%, and 99.4% for ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST, respectively, 35.6% and 99.3% for ResNet-34 on CIFAR-10 and MNIST, and 98.9% for NIN on MNIST, achieving low-computation inference.},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore distributed edge computation offloading (DECO) that offloads computation to distributed edge devices connected wirelessly, which perform the offloaded computation in parallel. By integrating edge computing with parallel computing, DECO can substantially reduce the total computation delay. In particular, we study the fundamental problem of minimizing the total completion time of DECO. We show that the time-sharing based communication resource allocation always outperforms the bandwidth-sharing scheme, so that it suffices to focus on the time-sharing based communication scheduling. Based on the time-sharing scheme, we first establish some structural properties of the optimal communication scheduling policy. Then, given these properties, we develop an efficient algorithm that finds the optimal allocation of computation workloads. Next, based on the optimal computation allocation, we characterize the optimal scheduling order of communications, which exhibits an elegant structure: the optimal order is in the non-decreasing order of the ratio between a device’s computation rate and its communication time. Last, based on the optimal computation allocation and communication scheduling, we show that the optimal device selection problem is a submodular minimization problem, so that it can be solved efficiently using some existing methods. We further extend the study to the setting where devices are subject to maximum computation workload constraints, and develop an efficient algorithm that finds the optimal computation workload allocation. Our results provide useful insights for the optimal computation-communication co-design for DECO. We evaluate the theoretical findings using extensive simulations in both practical settings and controlled settings, which demonstrate the performance of DECO in practice and also the efficiency of our proposed schemes and algorithms for DECO.},

Existing libraries for color programming provide only a thin layer of abstraction around matrix operations. Color programs are, thus, vulnerable to bugs arising from mathematically permissible but physically meaningless matrix computations. Correct implementations are difficult to write and optimize. We introduce CoolerSpace to facilitate physically correct and computationally efficient color programming. CoolerSpace raises the level of abstraction of color programming by allowing programmers to focus on describing the logic of color physics. Correctness and efficiency are handled by CoolerSpace. The type system in CoolerSpace assigns physical meaning and dimensions to user-defined objects. The typing rules permit only legal computations informed by color physics and perception. Along with type checking, CoolerSpace also generates performance-optimized programs using equality saturation. CoolerSpace is implemented as a Python library and compiles to ONNX, a common intermediate representation for tensor computations. CoolerSpace not only prevents common errors in color programming, but also does so without run-time overhead: even unoptimized CoolerSpace programs out-perform existing Python-based color programming systems by up to 5.7 times; our optimizations provide up to an additional 1.4 times speed-up.},

While betweenness centrality on static graphs has been extensively investigated, many real-world graphs are time-varying and modeled as temporal graphs. Examples include social networks and telecommunication networks, where a relationship between two vertices occurs at a specific time. Hence, in this paper, we target efficient methods for temporal betweenness centrality computation. We firstly propose an exact algorithm with the new notion of time instance graph, based on which, we derive a temporal dependency accumulation theory for iterative computation. To reduce the size of the time instance graph and improve the efficiency, we propose an additional optimization, which compresses the time instance graph with equivalent vertices and edges, and extends the dependency theory to the compressed graph. Since it is theoretically complex to compute temporal betweenness centrality, we further devise a probabilistically guaranteed approximate method to handle massive temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world temporal networks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods. In particular, our exact and approximate methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods by up to two and five orders of magnitude, respectively.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an emerging class of deep learning models specifically designed for graph-structured data. They have been effectively employed in a variety of real-world applications, including recommendation systems, drug development, and analysis of social networks. The GNN computation includes regular neural network operations and general graph convolution operations, which take most of the total computation time. Though several recent works have been proposed to accelerate the computation for GNNs, they face the limitations of heavy pre-processing, low efficiency atomic operations, and unnecessary kernel launches. In this article, we design TLPGNN, a lightweight two-level parallelism paradigm for GNN computation. First, we conduct a systematic analysis of the hardware resource usage of GNN workloads to understand the characteristics of GNN workloads deeply. With the insightful observations, we then divide the GNN computation into two levels, i.e., vertex parallelism for the first level and feature parallelism for the second. Next, we employ a novel hybrid dynamic workload assignment to address the imbalanced workload distribution. Furthermore, we fuse the kernels to reduce the number of kernel launches and cache the frequently accessed data into registers to avoid unnecessary memory traffic. To scale TLPGNN to multi-GPU environments, we propose an edge-aware row-wise 1-D partition method to ensure a balanced workload distribution across different GPU devices. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving substantial performance improvement over state-of-the-art GNN computation systems, including Deep Graph Library (DGL), GNNAdvisor, and FeatGraph, with speedups of 6.1\texttimes{}, 7.7\texttimes{}, and 3.0\texttimes{}, respectively, on average. Evaluations of multiple-GPU TLPGNN also demonstrate that our solution achieves both linear scalability and a well-balanced workload distribution.},

This paper shares our experience in optimizing stencil kernels on multi-core DSPs. Our approach combines coarse and fine-grained parallel optimization techniques to enhance the performance of stencil computations. Our optimizations include a vectorization-enabled micro-kernel to utilize instruction parallelism, a memory-aware data reuse strategy to maximize data locality across multiple memory levels and a triple-buffering mechanism to overlap computation and memory communications. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively utilize the memory bandwidth and the computation capability of the underlying hardware.

abstract = {The opioid epidemic is a persistent public health problem throughout Canada, with opioid-related deaths spiking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing on Brantford and Hamilton, Ontario, which have high rates of opioid poisoning, this participatory game jam project examines how 21 adults (ages 18+) with a history of opioid addiction make sense of their life experiences through the processes of autobiographical game-based storytelling, including ideation, narrative design, and environmental storytelling. Phenomenological interviews, processual artifacts like concept sketches, doodles, and reflections, and game prototypes generated through Scratch, Twine, and Bitsy facilitated the exploration of six key phenomena representing autobiographical game-based storytelling: maze metaphors, decision-making, compact games, morality and religion, resilience, and social communion. This interdisciplinary project explores how game-based storytelling supports recovery and restores dignity among adults experiencing opioid addiction while raising awareness of health inequities, thereby humanizing the opioid crisis.},

In this work, we interviewed six adults with DS, seven parents of adults with DS, and three experts in speech-language pathology, special education, and occupational therapy to determine how technology could support adults with DS. In our thematic analysis, four main themes emerged, including (1) community vs. home social involvement; (2) misalignment of skill expectations between adults with DS and parents; (3) family limitations in technology support; and (4) considerations for technology development. Our findings extend prior literature by including the voices of adults with DS in how and when they use technology.},

Our focus will be on explaining the difficulty of SVC via FGMC, and to this end, we identify general conditions on queries which enable reductions from FGMC to SVC. As a byproduct, we not only obtain alternative explanations for existing hardness results for SVC, but also new complexity results. In particular, we establish FP-#P complexity dichotomies for constant-free unions of connected CQs and connected homomorphism-closed graph queries. We also consider some variants of the SVC problem, by disallowing assumed facts or quantifying the contributions of constants rather than facts.},

abstract = {Stencil computations, which approximate differential equations in simulations, are important computations in high-performance computing. One of speed-up techniques is called temporal blocking, which reduces memory access by advancing computations of several time steps locally at a time. In addition, recent GPUs are equipped with units such as tensor cores that specialize in matrix operations, and there is a research project TCStencil, which applies them to stencil computations. In this paper, we integrate these two techniques to accelerate computation speed of stencil computations even further. This integration is not trivial, however, since temporal blocking introduces wider halo regions, while tensor cores only accelerate computations with restricted tensor sizes, such as 16 \texttimes{} 16. We describe our proposed method to alleviate performance issues. The evaluation results show that our implementations achieve notably speedup compared to existing versions. Especially, even compared to a version with tensor cores, our implementation with deeper temporal blocking shows speedup of approximately 1.25 times.},

However, AI-assistant responses and analysis code can be misaligned with the analyst’s intent or be seemingly correct but lead to incorrect conclusions. Therefore, validating AI assistance is crucial and challenging. Here, we explore how analysts understand and verify the correctness of AI-generated analyses. To observe analysts in diverse verification approaches, we develop a design probe equipped with natural language explanations, code, visualizations, and interactive data tables with common data operations. Through a qualitative user study (n=22) using this probe, we uncover common behaviors within verification workflows and how analysts’ programming, analysis, and tool backgrounds reflect these behaviors. Additionally, we provide recommendations for analysts and highlight opportunities for designers to improve future AI-assistant experiences.},

abstract = {The popularity of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) both in industry and academia owes credit to their flexible data model, suitable for data integration from multiple sources. Several KG-based applications such as trust assessment or view maintenance on dynamic data rely on the ability to compute provenance explanations for query results. The how-provenance of a query result is an expression that encodes the records (triples or facts) that explain its inclusion in the result set. This article proposes NPCS, a Native Provenance Computation approach for SPARQL queries. NPCS annotates query results with their how-provenance. By building upon spm-provenance semirings, NPCS supports both monotonic and non-monotonic SPARQL queries. Thanks to its reliance on query rewriting techniques, the approach is directly applicable to already deployed SPARQL engines using different reification schemes - including RDF-star. Our experimental evaluation on two popular SPARQL engines (GraphDB and Stardog) shows that our novel query rewriting brings a significant runtime improvement over existing query rewriting solutions, scaling to RDF graphs with billions of triples.},

abstract = {The advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has led to the emergence of various health and emotion care services, e.g., health monitoring. To cater to increasing computational requirements of IoMT services, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has emerged as an indispensable technology in smart health. Benefiting from the cost-effectiveness of deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with MEC servers in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) have emerged as a promising solution for providing smart health services in proximity to medical devices (MDs). However, the escalating number of MDs and the limited availability of communication resources of UAVs give rise to a significant increase in transmission latency. Moreover, due to the limited communication range of UAVs, the geographically-distributed MDs lead to workload imbalance of UAVs, which deteriorates the service response delay. To this end, this paper proposes a UAV-enabled Distributed computation Offloading and Power control method with Multi-Agent, named DOPMA, for NOMA-based IoMT environment. Specifically, this paper introduces computation and transmission queue models to analyze the dynamic characteristics of task execution latency and energy consumption. Moreover, a credit assignment scheme-based reward function is designed considering both system-level rewards and rewards tailored to each MD, and an improved multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is developed to derive offloading and power control decisions independently. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing schemes, achieving  (7.1% )  reduction in energy consumption and  (16% )  decrease in average delay.},

We start from the basic observation that mapping a strip of triangles onto a rectangular shape always yields a valid embedding, if the vertices that bound the strip are sorted coherently along the sides of the rectangle. Based on this intuition, we propose a straightforward algorithm, called Stripe Embedding, that operates by decomposing the input mesh into a set of triangle strips and then embeds each strip into the target domain by means of linear interpolation between two previously embedded vertices. Thanks to its simplicity, Stripe Embedding is extremely efficient and permits to switch to an exact implementation without almost increasing its running times. Stripe Embedding is up to three orders of magnitude faster than the Tutte embedding for same numerical model and, even when implemented with costly rational numbers, it is faster than any floating point implementation of prior methods at any scale.},

In this paper, we first analyze the restrictions of the existing models, and decompose the computation complexity into out-module block complexity and in-module block complexity. Based on the Plain Network block, we introduce layer normalization and channel attention to enhance the denoising ability. To reduce computational costs, we simplify the channel attention with linear computation to replace the original nonlinear activation functions inside it, and proposed SPLNet. Our model outperforms the mainstream methods, and exhibits good generalization ability on diverse datasets. Furthermore, SPLNet is useful for optical character recognition in RPA systems, which also enhance the overall ability and efficiency of RPA systems.},

abstract = {The k-plex model relaxes the clique model by allowing each vertex to miss up to k neighbors, including the vertex itself. A 1-plex is a clique. Many exact algorithms have been recently designed for finding the k-plex with the largest number of vertices, known as the maximum k-plex computation problem. However, all the existing algorithms, except BS, has the trivial worst-case time complexity of O*(2n) when ignoring polynomial factors. On the other hand, although BS improves the time complexity to O*(βkn) where βk &lt; 2 is a constant depending only on k, its practical performance is not satisfactory. In this paper, we study the maximum k-plex computation problem from both theory and practice. We first propose two new reduction rules and a new branching rule and prove that the base of the exponential time complexity is reduced to γk when the new reduction and branching rules are incorporated into a standard backtracking algorithm; here γk &lt; βk. We then design a two-stage approach kPlexT to improve the exponent of the time complexity by separating the search of large k-plexes from the search of small ones. We prove that kPlexT runs in O*((α Δ)k+1 γ_kα) time when the maximum k-plex size Ωk(G) is at least 2k-1, and in O*((α Δ)k+1 γ_kα + min(γkn, n2k-2)) time otherwise; here, α is the degeneracy and Δ is the maximum degree of the input graph. We also prove that with slight modification, kPlexT runs in O*((αΔ)k+1 (k+1)α+k-Ωk(G)) time when \o{}mega_k(G) ≥ 2k-1. Finally, we propose another reduction rule and a better initialization method to improve the practical performance of kPlexT. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that kPlexT achieves state-of-the-art practical performance. We also show that our improved time complexity carries over to other related problems such as enumerating all maximal k-plexes, quasi-cliques, and k-biplexes.},

The solutions to this system are exactly the sequential equilibria of the game. We construct this system explicitly and describe an implementation that solves it using cylindrical algebraic decomposition. To write consistency as a finite system of equations, we need to compute the extreme directions of a set of polyhedral cones.

The model consists of an anonymous network with synchronous rounds. In each round, each vertex can optionally transmit a signal to all its neighbors (beep). After the transmission of a signal, each vertex can only differentiate between no signal received, or at least one signal received. We assume that vertices have some knowledge about the topology of the network.We revisit the not self-stabilizing algorithm proposed by Jeavons, Scott, and Xu (2013), which computes an MIS in the beeping model. We enhance this algorithm to be self-stabilizing, and explore two different variants, which differ in the knowledge about the topology available to the vertices. In the first variant, every vertex knows an upper bound on the maximum degree Δ of the graph. For this case, we prove that the proposed self-stabilizing version maintains the same run-time as the original algorithm, i.e. it stabilizes after O(log n) rounds w.h.p. on any n-vertex graph. In the second variant, each vertex only knows an upper bound on its own degree. For this case, we prove that the algorithm stabilizes after O(log n · log log n) rounds on any n-vertex graph, w.h.p.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), manifested in the forms of technologies, systems, tools, and applications, has advanced rapidly, especially in recent years. It has permeated many aspects of human behavior and nearly all sectors of society, such as healthcare and education. In the context of early childhood education (ECE), AI has afforded valuable opportunities that directly and indirectly enhance children’s learning and development. While there are already two existing reviews of the literature on AI in ECE, they show either a lack of descriptive information concerning selected studies or inconsistencies between inclusion/exclusion criteria and selected studies, thereby raising concerns about their rigor. Representing a more methodologically rigorous effort and a significant contribution to the field of AI in ECE, this scoping study aimed to achieve three main goals: (1) “mapping” the global landscape of the current extent, range, and nature of relevant studies on the affordances of AI for use in ECE, (2) identifying potential research gaps, and (3) charting future research directions. Specifically, it addressed this overarching research question: What is the global landscape of the current state of knowledge concerning the affordances of AI for use in ECE? Specifically, the state of knowledge here refers to three aspects: (1) extent, (2) range, and (3) nature. First, regarding the extent aspect, the empirical knowledge was derived from 18 research articles in 11 countries and 16 peer-reviewed academic journals between 2005 and 2023, with 14 of these articles published in the past four years (2020–2023). Second, with respect to the range of study populations, it covered 15,081 children in early childhood (ages 2 to 8 years) across these 11 countries. Third, thematic analysis of these studies revealed four areas of AI affordances: (1) AI as tangible and intangible tools for interactive learning and information retrieval, (2) AI as technology for predicting/classifying children’s conditions, (3) AI as the object for learning by adapting to and personalizing children’s learning, and (4) AI as the subject for children's learning about it. Based on these findings, this scoping review identified three research gaps for future studies: (1) interviewing and/or surveying education stakeholders (parents, educators, policymakers) to explore the affordances of appropriate AI for use with, by, and for children bearing ethical considerations; (2) conducting group comparisons to investigate contextual factors contributing to the “AI divide” among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds; and (3) comparing sociocultural influences on AI use in ECE across cultures.},

abstract = {Packet level measurement in the data plane provides a microscopic view of the network’s state. Although advances in programmable switches and routers make it possible to measure the Sequence of Packet Lengths and Arrival Times (SPLT) in the data plane, collecting this information remains challenging due to limited storage, processing resources, and bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose MES, which Measures and Encodes Simultaneously the packet length and timestamp when each packet passes through the Network Processor (NP) in the switch/router. We design the packet length compression and timestamp compression algorithms to be lightweight and implement the designed algorithms using simple operations supported by the network processor, while taking into account the computation constraints of the NP. Through extensive experiments on five packet traces, we demonstrate that our MES achieves high precision SPLT measurements (up to 99.82% cosine similarity) while reducing storage and bandwidth overhead by up to 87%. Simulations conducted on the BMV2 P4 software switch demonstrate that our designed SPLT measurement mechanism imposes little impact on network throughput and delay.},

abstract = {To take full advantage of a specific hardware target, performance engineers need to gain control on compilers in order to leverage their domain knowledge about the program and hardware. Yet, modern compilers are poorly controlled, usually by configuring a sequence of coarse-grained monolithic black-box passes, or by means of predefined compiler annotations/pragmas. These can be effective, but often do not let users precisely optimize their varying compute loads. As a consequence, performance engineers have to resort to implementing custom passes for a specific optimization heuristic, requiring compiler engineering expert knowledge.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this paper, we present a technique that provides fine-grained control of general-purpose compilers by introducing the Transform dialect, a controllable IR-based transformation system implemented in MLIR. The Transform dialect empowers performance engineers to optimize their various compute loads by composing and reusing existing---but currently hidden---compiler features without the need to implement new passes or even rebuilding the compiler.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We demonstrate in five case studies that the Transform dialect enables precise, safe composition of compiler transformations and allows for straightforward integration with state-of-the-art search methods.},

The Teacher app facilitates educational experiences via group calls with students, while the IVR system offers students independent access to educational content using feature phones. To assess effectiveness and usability of SEEDS among students and teachers, we conducted a mixed-methods study involving 29 visually impaired students across five schools and five facilitators (3 sighted and 2 visually impaired) from Vision Empower Trust. Despite challenges like internet connectivity issues causing call drops, the study highlighted strong student engagement and a collaborative environment among facilitators.

abstract = {Matrix computation units have been equipped in current architectures to accelerate AI and high performance computing applications. The matrix multiplication and vector outer product are two basic instruction types. The latter one is lighter since the inputs are vectors. Thus it provides more opportunities to develop flexible algorithms for problems other than dense linear algebra computing and more possibilities to optimize the implementation. Stencil computations represent a common class of nested loops in scientific and engineering applications. This paper proposes a novel stencil algorithm using vector outer products. Unlike previous work, the new algorithm arises from the stencil definition in the scatter mode and is initially expressed with formulas of vector outer products. The implementation incorporates a set of optimizations to improve the memory reference pattern, execution pipeline and data reuse by considering various algorithmic options and the data sharing between input vectors. Evaluation on a simulator shows that our design achieves a substantial speedup compared with vectorized stencil algorithms.},

abstract = {Intel's Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI) provides higher efficiency on calculating dense linear algebra (DLA) computations than conventional SIMD instructions. However, existing auto-vectorizers frequently deliver suboptimal utilization of VNNI by either failing to recognize VNNI's unique computation pattern at the innermost loops/basic blocks, or producing inferior code through constrained and rudimentary peephole optimizations/pattern matching techniques. Auto-tuning frameworks might generate proficient code but are hampered by the necessity for sophisticated pattern templates and extensive search processes.This paper introduces a novel compilation methodology that generates high-performance VNNI-enabled code. By leveraging DLA's salient characteristics to identify VNNI's utilization opportunities, it proceeds to pinpoint the most effective strategies for feeding VNNI's inputs and hinding VNNI's execution latency via efficient memory access and register/cache reuse and exploited instruction-level parallelism. A tailored static cost analysis model guides this exploration, determining critical parameters for effective code transformation and generation. The evaluation on DLA and DNN workloads show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art industrial compilers and research works.},

abstract = {Cued Speech (CS) is a pure visual coding method used by hearing-impaired people that combines lip reading with several specific hand shapes to make the spoken language visible. Automatic CS recognition (ACSR) seeks to transcribe visual cues of speech into text, which can help hearing-impaired people to communicate effectively. The visual information of CS contains lip reading and hand cueing, thus the fusion of them plays an important role in ACSR. However, most previous fusion methods struggle to capture the global dependency present in long sequence inputs of multi-modal CS data. As a result, these methods generally fail to learn the effective cross-modal relationships that contribute to the fusion. Recently, attention-based transformers have been a prevalent idea for capturing the global dependency over the long sequence in multi-modal fusion, but existing multi-modal fusion transformers suffer from both poor recognition accuracy and inefficient computation for the ACSR task. To address these problems, we develop a novel computation and parameter efficient multi-modal fusion transformer by proposing a novel Token-Importance-Aware Attention mechanism (TIAA), where a token utilization rate (TUR) is formulated to select the important tokens from the multi-modal streams. More precisely, TIAA firstly models the modality-specific fine-grained temporal dependencies over all tokens of each modality, and then learns the efficient cross-modal interaction for the modality-shared coarse-grained temporal dependencies over the important tokens of different modalities. Besides, a light-weight gated hidden projection is designed to control the feature flows of TIAA. The resulting model, named &lt;italic&gt;Eco&lt;/italic&gt;nomical &lt;italic&gt;Cued&lt;/italic&gt; Speech Fusion Transformer (&lt;italic&gt;EcoCued&lt;/italic&gt;), achieves state-of-the-art performance on all existing CS datasets (i.e., Mandarin Chinese, French, and British CS), compared with existing transformer-based fusion methods and ACSR fusion methods. Notably, our method dramatically reduces the computational complexity from &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$mathcal {O}(T^{2})$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; to &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation="LaTeX"&gt;$mathcal {O}(T)$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;.

abstract = {Predicting the physical interaction of proteins is a cornerstone problem in computational biology. New classes of learning-based algorithms are actively being developed, and are typically trained end-to-end on protein complex structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank. These training datasets tend to be large and difficult to use for prototyping and, unlike image or natural language datasets, they are not easily interpretable by non-experts. We present Dock2D-IP and Dock2D-IF, two “toy” datasets that can be used to select algorithms predicting protein-protein interactions—or any other type of molecular interactions. Using two-dimensional shapes as input, each example from Dock2D-IP (“interaction pose”) describes the interaction pose of two shapes known to interact and each example from Dock2D-IF (“interaction fact”) describes whether two shapes form a stable complex or not, regardless of how they bind. We propose a number of baseline solutions to the problem and show that the same underlying energy function can be learned either by solving the interaction pose task (formulated as an energy-minimization “docking” problem) or the fact-of-interaction task (formulated as a binding free energy estimation problem).},

Non-verbal behaviors are critical in interpersonal interactions. However, whether computer vision-detected non-verbal behaviors can effectively estimate the interaction intensity of intimate couples is still unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel measurements and investigated their feasibility to estimate interaction intensities through machine learning regression models. Analyses were conducted based on a conflict-resolution conversation video dataset of intimate couples before and after acute alcohol consumption. Results showed the estimation error was at the lowest in the no-alcohol state but significantly increased if the model trained using no-alcohol data was applied to after-alcohol data, indicating that alcohol altered the interaction data in the feature space. While training a model using rich after-alcohol data is ideal to address the performance decrease, data collection in such a risky state is challenging in real life. Thus, we proposed a new State-Induced Domain Adaptation (SIDA) framework, which allows for improving estimation performance using only a small after-alcohol training dataset, pointing to a future direction of addressing data scarcity issues.},

abstract = {In computer science, teaching first-year students to approach problems at varying levels of abstraction is both essential and challenging. While abstraction is a key component of problem solving, many students struggle with thinking abstractly. When presented with a problem, students often rush into coding, feeling closer to a solution through immediate feedback from the compiler or by simulating their code. However, this approach can cause them to overlook essential details, as their code may not account for all possible input scenarios. To address this issue, we introduced a programming methodology in our Introduction to Programming (CS1) course. This methodology requires students to first construct a graphical representation of their solution, ensuring coverage of all potential input cases, before translating it into code. To support regular practice in this diagrammatic reasoning process, we developed a learning tool called CAF\'{E} 2.0. Over the course of the semester, students use CAF\'{E} 2.0 to solve problems by submitting both a graphical model of their solution and the associated code implementation. In addition to evaluating the final code, CAF\'{E} 2.0 provides personalized feedback on the graphical model and how well it aligns with the code. This feedback guides students in refining their model and code, and resubmit them to get new feedback. CAF\'{E} 2.0's unique feature is its ability to automatically generate feedback on graphical models within an interactive online environment, fostering an engaging and supportive learning experience.},

abstract = {In this work, we study fault tolerance of transient errors, such as those occurring due to cosmic radiation or hardware component aging and degradation, using Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance (ABFT). ABFT methods typically work by adding some additional computation in the form of invariant checksums which, by definition, should not change as the program executes. By computing and monitoring checksums, it is possible to detect errors by observing differences in the checksum values. However, this is challenging for two key reasons: (1) it requires careful manual analysis of the input program, and (2) care must be taken to subsequently carry out the checksum computations efficiently enough for it to be worth it. Prior work has shown how to apply ABFT schemes with low overhead for a variety of input programs. Here, we focus on a subclass of programs called stencil applications, an important class of computations found widely in various scientific computing domains. We propose a new compilation scheme to automatically analyze and generate the checksum computations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to do such a thing in a compiler. We show that low overhead code can be easily generated and provide a preliminary evaluation of the tradeoff between performance and effectiveness.},

By modeling these scenarios as cooperative simple games, we leverage pivotal probabilities to transform the computation into a problem of counting beneficiaries. Moreover, we make an insightful observation that the Shapley values can be computed using subsets of minimal syntheses within the inclusion-exclusion framework in combinatorics. Based on this insight, we develop a game decomposition approach and utilize techniques in Boolean function decomposition into disjunctive normal form. One interesting property of our method is that the time complexity depends only on the data owners participating in those minimal syntheses, rather than all the data owners. Extensive experiments with real data sets demonstrate a significant efficiency improvement for computing the Shapley values in data assemblage tasks modeled as simple games.},

abstract = {Undergraduate computer science programs worldwide struggle to attract and retain underrepresented students for many reasons. Culture, stereotype threats, uneven gender and racial representations, lack of role models, and uncertain career prospects for minority groups are among the many reasons behind this situation. Many computer science programs are trying to change course through strategies to foster equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), aimed at improving outreach, recruitment, admissions, and retention of underrepresented students. EDI approaches may also include modifications to the undergraduate computer science curriculum. However, if not properly planned, these modifications risk amplifying existing stereotypes rather than producing positive change [38]. In this study, through an extensive literature review, a rigorous curriculum analysis of 49 computer science programs across the globe, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of surveys and interviews bringing in the voices of 613 students and 30 educators participating from around the world, we explore equity, diversity, and inclusion in the computer science curriculum. We highlight the role of inclusive content and course design, discuss program flexibility, and the impact of inclusive courses and program design in attracting and retaining historically marginalized students. Finally, we provide concrete steps to make computing science undergraduate curricula more appealing to a diverse audience.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to perform tasks in the field of code generation. However, there is still a gap between LLMs being capable coders and being top-tier software engineers. The most recent trend is using LLM-based agents to iterate the code generation process. Based on the observation that top-level software engineers often ask clarifying questions to reduce Ambiguity in both requirements and coding solutions, we argue that the same should be applied to LLMs for code generation tasks. For this purpose, we define the communication skills of LLMs as “being able to ask clarifying questions when the description of the code generation problem has issues”. In this study, we restrict these issues to three matters from the software requirement engineering field: inconsistent requirements, ambiguous requirements, and incomplete requirements. By asking probing questions about the requirements of problem descriptions before generating the final code, the challenges of programming with LLMs, such as unclear intent specification may be alleviated, resulting to a correct code in the initial iterations.In this work, we conducted an empirical study on the benchmark and analysis of the communication skills of LLMs for code generation. We created a new benchmark, HumanEvalComm, by modifying problem descriptions according to three issues mentioned above, Inconsistency, Ambiguity, Incompleteness. We then experimented on HumanEvalComm with different Code LLMs, and a new LLM agent approach, Code Clarification and Generation Agent (Okanagan), to identify and ask questions in ambiguous parts from code and descriptions for further refining the generated code. In the evaluation, we introduced an LLM-based evaluator and created Communication Rate and Good Question Rate as the evaluation metrics to represent the ratio of questions asked and questions with good quality in responses. We found that more than 60% of responses from Code LLMs still generate code rather than ask questions when the problem descriptions are manually modified according to different clarification categories. The Pass@1 and Test Pass Rate of most Code LLMs drop by 35%  (sim)  52% and by 17%  (sim)  35% respectively, with statistical significance in each category for over 75% numbers. Okanagan, as an LLM agent approach that uses LLM such as ChatGPT 3.5, effectively increases the Communication Rate and Good Question Rate by an absolute 58% and 38%, respectively. Thus, Okanagan boosts Pass@1 and Test Pass Rate by an absolute 8% and 7%, respectively, when the problem descriptions are modified based on given clarification categories. This result indicates the potential for achieving more effective communication capability using LLM agent. Our benchmark and full code are publicly available at .},

abstract = {Mathematical language is a cornerstone of a child’s mathematical development, and children can effectively acquire this language through storytelling with a knowledgeable and engaging partner. In this study, we leverage the recent advances in large language models to conduct free-form, creative conversations with children. Consequently, we developed Mathemyths, a joint storytelling agent that takes turns co-creating stories with children while integrating mathematical terms into the evolving narrative. This paper details our development process, illustrating how prompt-engineering can optimize LLMs for educational contexts. Through a user study involving 35 children aged 4-8 years, our results suggest that when children interacted with Mathemyths, their learning of mathematical language was comparable to those who co-created stories with a human partner. However, we observed differences in how children engaged with co-creation partners of different natures. Overall, we believe that LLM applications, like Mathemyths, offer children a unique conversational experience pertaining to focused learning objectives.},

abstract = {Recently, correctional facilities meant for offender reformation have been left out of technological advances pertaining to mobile application development and human computer interaction. Designed to basically aid offender management, the sentence computation application (ScApp) is essentially a mobile collaborative platform for sentence calculation, offender information collection and storage, processing, searching, and notification. Therefore, the study is aimed at evaluating the behavioral aspects of correctional staff's adoption of ScApp using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The study comprised 69 participants who are officers of the Nigerian Correctional Service, selected through a multi-stage sampling technique. Based on five-point rated responses of correctional officers, the internal consistency of the ScApp was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha reliability analysis after deriving the zero-order inter-item correlation. The results showed that the independent contributions of anxiety, facilitating conditions, and attitude towards technology are predictors of participants’ behavioural intentions to use the ScApp.},

abstract = {Effective resistance (ER) is a fundamental metric for measuring node similarities in a graph, and it finds applications in various domains including graph clustering, recommendation systems, link prediction, and graph neural networks. The state-of-the-art algorithm for computing effective resistance relies on a landmark technique, which involves selecting a node that is easy to reach by all the other nodes as a landmark. The performance of this technique heavily depends on the chosen landmark node. However, in many real-life graphs, it is not always possible to find an easily reachable landmark node, which can significantly hinder the algorithm's efficiency. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel multiple landmarks technique which involves selecting a set of landmark nodes Vl such that the other nodes in the graph can easily reach any one of a landmark node in Vl. Specifically, we first propose several new formulas to compute ER with multiple landmarks, utilizing the concept of Schur complement. These new formulas allow us to pre-compute and maintain several small-sized matrices related to Vl as a compact index. With this powerful index technique, we demonstrate that both single-pair and single-source ER queries can be efficiently answered using a newly-developed Vl-absorbed random walk sampling or Vl-absorbed push technique. Comprehensive theoretical analysis shows that all proposed index-based algorithms achieve provable performance guarantees for both single-pair and single-source ER queries. Extensive experiments on 5 real-life datasets demonstrate the high efficiency of our multiple landmarks-based index techniques. For instance, our algorithms, with a 1.5 GB index size, can be up to 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms while achieving the same accuracy on a large road network.},

abstract = {Assessing convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based analyses is crucial but challenging, especially so in high dimensional and complex spaces such as the space of phylogenetic trees (treespace). In practice, it is assumed that the target distribution is the unique stationary distribution of the MCMC and convergence is achieved when samples appear to be stationary. Here we leverage recent advances in computational geometry of the treespace and introduce a method that combines classical statistical techniques and algorithms with geometric properties of the treespace to automatically evaluate and assess practical convergence of phylogenetic MCMC analyses. Our method monitors convergence across multiple MCMC chains and achieves high accuracy in detecting both practical convergence and convergence issues within treespace. Furthermore, our approach is developed to allow for real-time evaluation during the MCMC algorithm run, eliminating any of the chain post-processing steps that are currently required. Our tool therefore improves reliability and efficiency of MCMC based phylogenetic inference methods and makes analyses easier to reproduce and compare. We demonstrate the efficacy of our diagnostic via a well-calibrated simulation study and provide examples of its performance on real data sets. Although our method performs well in practice, a significant part of the underlying treespace probability theory is still missing, which creates an excellent opportunity for future mathematical research in this area.},

abstract = {Algorithms often have tunable parameters that impact performance metrics such as runtime and solution quality. For many algorithms used in practice, no parameter settings admit meaningful worst-case bounds, so the parameters are made available for the user to tune. Alternatively, parameters may be tuned implicitly within the proof of a worst-case approximation ratio or runtime bound. Worst-case instances, however, may be rare or nonexistent in practice. A growing body of research has demonstrated that a data-driven approach to parameter tuning can lead to significant improvements in performance. This approach uses a training set of problem instances sampled from an unknown, application-specific distribution and returns a parameter setting with strong average performance on the training set.We provide techniques for deriving generalization guarantees that bound the difference between the algorithm’s average performance over the training set and its expected performance on the unknown distribution. Our results apply no matter how the parameters are tuned, be it via an automated or manual approach. The challenge is that for many types of algorithms, performance is a volatile function of the parameters: slightly perturbing the parameters can cause a large change in behavior. Prior research&nbsp;[e.g., 12, 16, 20, 62] has proved generalization bounds by employing case-by-case analyses of greedy algorithms, clustering algorithms, integer programming algorithms, and selling mechanisms. We streamline these analyses with a general theorem that applies whenever an algorithm’s performance is a piecewise-constant, piecewise-linear, or—more generally—piecewise-structured function of its parameters. Our results, which are tight up to logarithmic factors in the worst case, also imply novel bounds for configuring dynamic programming algorithms from computational biology.},

abstract = {The emerging edge networks are cloud-native. Flows with computation needs are processed in-flight by compute nodes inside the network. Routing with In-Network Processing (RINP) not only has to maintain network-wide load balance on communication and computation elements, but also has to quickly restore flows upon various types of failures. In this paper, we propose a novel path-based two-stage traffic engineering scheme to trade-off between routing model complexity, network performance in the normal stage, and restoration efficiency upon failures. For the normal stage, our model jointly optimizes computation demand allocation and traffic flow routing. We further speed-up RINP calculation by controlling the path budget and decoupling computation allocation and traffic routing. For the restoration stage, we develop a fast restoration scheme that only re-routes the flows traversing the failed elements to achieve close-to-optimal network delay performance while minimizing the fraction of unrestored flows. Evaluation results on real network instances demonstrate that in the normal stage, our scheme achieves near-optimal performance with up to 50--100x speedup compared to link-based routing models. In the restoration stage, our scheme can restore most of the affected traffic with up to 10x speedup compared to globally rerouting all the flows.},

abstract = {Near data accelerators (NDAs) enable near data processing (NDP) within main memory that benefits performance by providing more aggregated bandwidth and reducing longdistance data transfer. Most prior works focus on reaping higher internal bandwidth to improve performance of the NDA itself. However, the overhead of interactive communication between host and NDAs is overlooked, which has become the bottleneck of NDP systems. In this paper, we propose bridge-NDP, a novel NDP architecture that exploits existing memory buses serving as bridge buses to fully utilize bandwidth. With bridge access enabled by optimized bridge commands, bridge-NDP efficiently overlaps communication and computation. It can be applied to existing NDP systems regardless of the memory level NDAs are attached to. For a variety of key computing kernels from machine learning, data analytics, etc., our evaluation shows that bridge-NDP speeds up not only the NDA performance itself (1.13\texttimes{}-3.62\texttimes{}), but also the host-NDA collaboration performance (2.43\texttimes{}-4.21\texttimes{}), achieving more bandwidth utilization (1.12\texttimes{}-3.67\texttimes{} and 1.48\texttimes{}-4.13\texttimes{}) over the state-of-the-art NDP solution.},

abstract = {In the past decade, tens of homomorphic encryption compilers have been released, and there are good reasons for these compilers to exist. Firstly, homomorphic encryption is a powerful secure computation technique in that it is relatively easy for parties to switch from plaintext computation to secure computations when compared to techniques like secret sharing. However, the technique is mathematically involved and requires expert knowledge to express computations as homomorphic encryption operations. So, these compilers support users who might otherwise not have the time or expertise to optimize the computation manually. Another reason is that homomorphic encryption is still computationally expensive, so compilers allow users to optimize their secure computation tasks. One major shortcoming of these compilers is that they often do not allow users to use high-level primitives, such as equality checks, comparisons, and AND and OR operations between many operands. The compilers that do are either based on TFHE, requiring large bootstrapping keys that must be sent to the evaluator, or they only work in the Boolean domain, excluding many potentially more performant circuits. Moreover, compilers must reduce the multiplicative depth of the circuits they generate to minimize the noise growth inherent to these homomorphic encryption schemes. However, many compilers only consider reducing the depth as an afterthought. We propose the Oraqle compiler, which solves both problems at once by implementing depth-aware arithmetization, a technique for expressing high-level primitives as arithmetic operations that are executable by homomorphic encryption libraries. Instead of generating one possible circuit, the compiler generates multiple circuits that trade off the number of multiplications with the multiplicative depth. If the depth of the resulting circuits is low enough, they may be evaluated using a BFV or BGV library that does not require bootstrapping keys. We demonstrate that our compiler allows for significant performance gains.},

abstract = {Graph Neural Network (GNN) learning over non-Euclidean graph data has recently drawn a rapid increase of interest in many domains. Generalized sparse computation is crucial for maximizing the performance of GNN learning, while most recent GNNs primarily focused on optimizing coarse-grained parallelism associated with nodes, edges, and additional feature dimensions. However, efficiently implementing generalized sparse computation is challenging. The performance optimization of generalized sparse computation lacking in-depth architecture-aware design is seldom supported by existing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and is hard to be tuned by experts, which involves substantial trial and error. In this work, we propose G-Sparse, a new compiler framework that extends the popular Halide compiler to enable effective acceleration for generalized sparse computations for GNNs through compiler-driven optimizations and auto-tuning. To facilitate generalized sparse computations, G-Sparse separates algorithms from schedules and introduces several novel sparse computation optimization techniques for modern GPUs, including two-dimensional shared memory optimizations and efficient cost-driven design space exploration and auto-tuning. Extensive evaluation against highly-optimized state-of-the-art sparse computation kernels and on end-to-end GNN training and inference efficiency has demonstrated that our proposed G-Sparse achieves up to a 4.75\texttimes{} speedup over the state-of-the-art sparse kernels, and a training and inference speedup of 1.37\texttimes{}~ 2.25\texttimes{} over three popular GNN frameworks including GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT.

This progress has invited numerous studies of user interaction. However, less is known about the struggles and strategies of non-experts, for whom each step of the text-to-code problem presents challenges: describing their intent in natural language, evaluating the correctness of generated code, and editing prompts when the generated code is incorrect. This paper presents a large-scale controlled study of how 120 beginning coders across three academic institutions approach writing and editing prompts. A novel experimental design allows us to target specific steps in the text-to-code process and reveals that beginners struggle with writing and editing prompts, even for problems at their skill level and when correctness is automatically determined. Our mixed-methods evaluation provides insight into student processes and perceptions with key implications for non-expert Code LLM use within and outside of education.},

To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13–18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications. Our analysis reveals how multi-user model building with Co-ML, in the context of student-driven projects created during the summer camp, supported development of DDPs including incorporating data diversity, evaluating model performance, and inspecting for data quality. Additionally, we found that students’ attempts to improve model performance often prioritized learnability over class balance. Through this work, we highlight how the combination of collaboration, model testing interfaces, and student-driven projects can empower learners to actively engage in exploring the role of data in ML systems.},

abstract = {Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been used as a treatment for several psychiatric and neurological disorders, including depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, addiction and Parkinson's disease. However, the precise mechanism of action of DLPFC rTMS and how it translates to the effectiveness of treatment of these disorders is not fully understood. In this study, we provide a review of computational explanations of how DLPFC rTMS may treat several clinical disorders. The review show that DLPFC rTMS can ameliorate several symptoms in different psychiatric and neurological disorders via the following mechanisms of action: (a) modulating the activations of several cortical and subcortical areas, (b) increasing dopamine levels in both cortical and subcortical structures, and (c) modulating connectivity among several brain areas. In addition, we discuss future directions on experimental and computational studies of DLPFC rTMS. Specifically, future computational modelling should take into account the multi-dimensional nature of DLPFC rTMS effect on the brain and behaviour.},

abstract = {Objectives. Athletics and sports represent a focal part of adolescence for millions of youth around the world. However, opportunities to engage in computer science learning experiences are less prevalent, particularly among Hispanic and low-income communities. Recently, researchers have explored ways to bridge these, seemingly, disparate disciplines. Much of this prior research centers on the proliferation of sports technologies that support individualistic learning experiences. Additionally, many of these experiences are developed by researchers with limited design contributions from sports practitioners. To extend prior work, this project centers youth athletic identities and the associated cultural contexts of sports to explore ways that computing technologies can enhance and develop youth athletic identities and sports performance. Moreover, this work surfaces ways that athletics can be a generative and fulfilling space to learn about computer science.Participants. In summer 2021, we collaborated with basketball coaches to design and implement a computing-enhanced learning experience with a basketball team of Hispanic participants in Puerto Rico. Eleven basketball athletes from a high school in southern Puerto Rico participated in the study. The participants have strong sports identities, as demonstrated by their lifelong engagement with team sports. Conversely, only one out of the eleven participants had experienced sports technologies, and none of them had previously participated in computing learning experiences.Study Method. In collaboration with local basketball coaches, we co-designed a learning experience that centers sports identities and practices and adds computing as a way to extend existing sports identities and local sports activities. We present and evaluate this learning experience using a design-based research approach. Participants’ feedback was collected in the form of surveys, designs, and journal entries, and additional data on their experiences were collected via videos and researchers’ field notes. Using a mixed-methods approach, we highlight existing participants’ identities and perceptions as well as their experiences with our design. We complement quantitative analysis of survey responses with case studies.Findings. We find that our design can provide shifts in youth student-athletes’ perceptions of computing. Additionally, hands-on experiences with computing tools enable participants to start practicing computer science sensemaking via learning how different computing tools can support their sports performance individually and as a team. Furthermore, we find that the material, ideational and relational resources made available through camp:bit supported each participant differently, while collectively providing a space for all of them to have meaningful and fulfilling experiences. Finally, we find that this design can foster and support sports team cohesion.Conclusions. We provide in-depth descriptions of our design, the youth’s engagement with it, and how these learning experiences can be further applied in sports spaces. These examples highlight a unique conception of practice-linked computational identities—where learners’ computational identities are grounded in a specific culturally relevant practice, enabling a more culturally sustaining computing learning experience. Finally, our analysis suggests five design principles for designing and conducting computing-supported learning experiences in sports environments. The principles are as follows: 1. Sports Experience: Authentically Support Existing Identities. 2. Team Dynamics: Team Athletes are Part of a Whole. 3. Individual Pursuits: Supporting Individual Paths. 4. Direct Interactions: Conversations with Materials and Ideas. 5. Interdisciplinary Facilitation Team: Complementary Skills. These design principles can be used by researchers, practitioners, and local stakeholders to implement sport-centric CS learning experiences to extend and enhance the way student-athletes from marginalized communities practice sports, as well as to activate interest and engagement in CS.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are essential to understanding cellular mechanisms, signaling networks, disease processes, and drug development, as they represent the physical contacts and functional associations between proteins. Recent advances have witnessed the achievements of artificial intelligence (AI) methods aimed at predicting PPIs. However, these approaches often handle the intricate web of relationships and mechanisms among proteins, drugs, diseases, ribonucleic acid (RNA), and protein structures in a fragmented or superficial manner. This is typically due to the limitations of non-end-to-end learning frameworks, which can lead to sub-optimal feature extraction and fusion, thereby compromising the prediction accuracy. To address these deficiencies, this paper introduces a novel end-to-end learning model, the Knowledge Graph Fused Graph Neural Network (KGF-GNN). This model comprises three integral components: (1) &lt;bold&gt;Protein Associated Network (PAN) Construction&lt;/bold&gt;: We begin by constructing a PAN that extensively captures the diverse relationships and mechanisms linking proteins with drugs, diseases, RNA, and protein structures. (2) &lt;bold&gt;Graph Neural Network for Feature Extraction&lt;/bold&gt;: A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is then employed to distill both topological and semantic features from the PAN, alongside another GNN designed to extract topological features directly from observed PPI networks. (3) &lt;bold&gt;Multi-layer Perceptron for Feature Fusion&lt;/bold&gt;: Finally, a multi-layer perceptron integrates these varied features through end-to-end learning, ensuring that the feature extraction and fusion processes are both comprehensive and optimized for PPI prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world PPI datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed KGF-GNN approach, which not only achieves high accuracy in predicting PPIs but also significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art models. This work not only enhances our ability to predict PPIs with a higher precision but also contributes to the broader application of AI in Bioinformatics, offering profound implications for biological research and therapeutic development.},

In a CS1 class, a key to effective learning lies in identifying students' productive and less-productive coding habits. One way to gain such insights is to review the steps students take while coding. Therefore, students need coding tools that collect and display data about their working process. This tutorial introduces CS1 teachers to Process Feedback, a free online compiler that makes the coding process transparent. It enables students to explore their working process so they can self-reflect and learn. By focusing on the process, students are motivated to excel not only in their final code but also in how they approach coding. Analyzing process data also helps students develop critical thinking and metacognitive skills. The compiler also translates compiler-generated error messages to plain English explanations, enabling students to use AI in a safeguarded manner. During the tutorial, participants will learn how they can integrate the Process Feedback compiler into their courses and how their students can use it. The online compiler is available at www.processfeedback.org, and students do not need to create an account to use it. Participants are expected to bring their laptops to the tutorial.},

A session-based recommender system processes a given sequence of products browsed by a user and suggests the most relevant next product to display to the user. State-of-the-art session-based recommender systems are often a type of deep learning black box, so explaining their results is a challenge.In this paper, we propose an approach with a grammatical expression that provides explanations of recommendations generated by session-based recommender systems as well as an evolutionary algorithm, GE-XAI-SBRS, based on Grammatical Evolution, with its own initialization and crossover operators, to construct such a grammatical expression. Our approach uses latent product representations, so-called vector embeddings, generated by the recommender systems and providing some additional knowledge on dependencies between products.Computational experiments on the YooChoose dataset being one of the most popular session-based benchmarks, and the recommendations generated by the Target Attentive Graph Neural Network (TAGNN) model confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach, the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and outperforming the regular GE algorithm in the task under consideration.},

abstract = {Curiosity is increasingly being looked at to develop interactive non-human agents capable of lifelong learning, particularly in the space of Ai driven agents. However, the way a non-human agent’s mental state is described could prime expectations in human counterparts as well as alter perceptions of an agent’s behavior. We conducted an online experiment examining people’s perceptions of four levels of curious behavior portrayed by a robot agent and whether this behavior matched people’s expectations when primed to anticipate a “curious” vs. “learning” vs. “autonomous” robot agent. As curiosity increased, the ratings of the robot agent’s thinking ability also increased. This was juxtaposed by a decrease in the robot’s ratings as an effective worker and social agent. Further, we captured a unique trajectory of expectation matching showing that agents’ internal mental states should be matched with analogous external behaviors. Our findings have implications for the design and development of non-human agents that engage in learning modeled on forms of human cognition.},

Whether differential methylation and copy number variation have combined effects on gene expression is largely unknown. We use a multivariate linear model to formulate the relationship among the three genomic measurements, gene expression, copy number, and methylation levels. We propose a method that combines a distance covariance measure and the group LASSO to analyze multiple types of genomic data collectively for the purpose of insightfully revealing how gene expression is potentially affected by both copy number variation and differential methylation levels in cellular process. Our approach is of two stages, the first is a variable screening process in which a variable selection method is utilized by employing the concept of joint distance covariance (JdCov) of random vectors, and the second is to implement a penalized regression approach, a group LASSO, on the screened data of much lower dimension. The two-stage approach is tested in extensive simulation studies and shown to be effective. The approach is then applied to the TCGA Melanoma data, which consists of gene expression, methylation and copy number measurements of more than 300 patients and relationship of some genes with methylation and copy number measurements were revealed for the involved subjects.},

Rhyme is one such element that can help to inspect style in an artistic piece of writing. It is a literary device that adds melody and aesthetics to any poetic composition.

The research examines the works of five prominent Hindi poets, namely Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, Jayshankar Prasad, Sumitranandan Pant, Mahadevi Verma, and Harivansh Rai Bachchan, while using their poems as its case study. It provides the rhyme consistency score as a novel stylistic function verified using relevant statistical tests.

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving landscape of cross-device computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for intuitive and user-friendly solutions empowering end users to create and tailor their applications. To address this need, we analysed the different metaphors for end-user development (EUD) of cross-device and IoT applications. A key observation is the lack of addressing end user’s mental models when designing interactions among devices, resulting in less intuitive EUD tools. To fill this gap, we introduce eSPACE, an end-user authoring tool facilitating the development of cross-device and IoT applications. In contrast to most existing tools, eSPACE is grounded on strong theoretical foundations, including a conceptual model, reference framework as well as design guidelines and suitable metaphors. The effectiveness of these theoretical foundations in creating an intuitive and user-friendly EUD platform has been validated in a user study. Our study confirms eSPACE’s potential as a useful and easy to use tool for end-user application development. In addition, we present potential future research directions, including automation functionality, intelligibility and human-AI interaction.

abstract = {We propose an inverse curvature design method for programmable textiles, i.e., self-morphing structures that combine a pre-stretched fabric and elastic rods in a planar state. Specifically, we target a class of structures consisting of a quadrangular grid with all rods interconnected to create a periodically corrugated shape, which offers surface programmability and resilience of the structure. The shape of such a structure is the result of a complex nonlinear equilibrium. We bypass the costly inverse computation of such equilibrium by decomposing the computation of macroscopic shrinkage behavior solved geometrically and microscopic material behavior modeled through experiments. We first investigate the behavior of programmable textiles through experiments, subsequently construct a geometric model to represent the deformation, and then propose a three-step inverse design method. The design method first calculates a conformal mapping of the target shape onto a planar region. Then, we determine an optimized grid layout for arranging rods satisfying geometric constraints on this planar region. Finally, the cross-sectional shapes of the rods at each part are computed based on experimental results. Thanks to our geometric model, there are smaller geometric constraints than the number of variables for determining the grid layouts. This design flexibility allows the grid layout to incorporate smooth boundary conditions and user preferences on the grid shapes. We demonstrate the validity and potential of our approach through design examples and comparisons with the target shape.},

abstract = {As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues transforming workplaces globally, particularly within the Information Technology (IT) industry, understanding its impact on IT professionals and computing curricula is crucial. This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment. Additionally, it highlights the need for educational institutions to adapt curricula to address these emerging demands effectively},

abstract = {This paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.},

abstract = {Multiplying two sparse matrices (SpGEMM) is a common computational primitive used in many areas including graph algorithms, bioinformatics, algebraic multigrid solvers, and randomized sketching. Distributed-memory parallel algorithms for SpGEMM have mainly focused on sparsity-oblivious approaches that use 2D and 3D partitioning. Sparsity-aware 1D algorithms can theoretically reduce communication by not fetching nonzeros of the sparse matrices that do not participate in the multiplication.Here, we present a distributed-memory 1D SpGEMM algorithm and implementation. It uses MPI RDMA operations to mitigate the cost of packing/unpacking submatrices for communication, and it uses a block fetching strategy to avoid excessive finegrained messaging. Our results show that our 1D implementation outperforms state-of-the-art 2D and 3D implementations within CombBLAS for many configurations, inputs, and use cases, while remaining conceptually simpler.},

abstract = {Stencil-based applications play an essential role in high-performance systems as they occur in numerous computational areas, such as partial differential equation solving. In this context, Iterative Stencil Loops (ISLs) represent a prominent and well-known algorithmic class within the stencil domain. Specifically, ISL-based calculations iteratively apply the same stencil to a multi-dimensional point grid multiple times or until convergence. However, due to their iterative and intensive nature, ISLs are highly performance-hungry, demanding specialized solutions. Here, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) represent a valid architectural choice as they enable the design of custom, parallel, and scalable ISL accelerators. Besides, the regular structure of ISLs makes them an ideal candidate for automatic optimization and generation flows. For these reasons, this article introduces Senju, an automation framework for the design of highly parallel ISL accelerators targeting single-/multi-FPGA systems. Given an input description, Senju automates the entire design process and provides accurate performance estimations. The experimental evaluation shows remarkable and scalable results, outperforming single- and multi-FPGA literature approaches under different metrics. Finally, we present a new analysis of temporal and spatial parallelism trade-offs in a real-case scenario and discuss our performance through a single- and novel specialized multi-FPGA formulation of the Roofline Model.},

abstract = {Automated machine learning streamlines the task of finding effective machine learning pipelines by automating model training, evaluation, and selection. Traditional evaluation strategies, like cross-validation (CV), generate one value that averages the accuracy of a pipeline's predictions. This single value, however, may not fully describe the generalizability of the pipeline. Here, we present Lexicase-based Validation (lexidate), a method that uses multiple, independent prediction values for selection. Lexidate splits training data into a learning set and a selection set. Pipelines are trained on the learning set and make predictions on the selection set. The predictions are graded for correctness and used by lexicase selection to identify parent pipelines. Compared to 10-fold CV, lexicase reduces the training time. We test the effectiveness of three lexi-date configurations within the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool 2 (TPOT2) package on six OpenML classification tasks. In one configuration, we detected no difference in the accuracy of the final model returned from TPOT2 on most tasks compared to 10-fold CV. All configurations studied here returned similar or less complex final pipelines compared to 10-fold CV.},

abstract = {We present ViPRA-Haplo, a &lt;italic&gt;de novo&lt;/italic&gt; strain-specific assembly workflow for reconstructing viral haplotypes in a viral population from paired-end next generation sequencing (NGS) data. The proposed Viral Path Reconstruction Algorithm (ViPRA) generates a subset of paths from a De Bruijn graph of reads using the pairing information of reads. The paths generated by ViPRA are an over-estimation of the true contigs. We propose two refinement methods to obtain an optimal set of contigs representing viral haplotypes. The first method clusters paths reconstructed by ViPRA using VSEARCH Deorowicz et al. 2015 based on sequence similarity, while the second method, MLEHaplo, generates a maximum likelihood estimate of viral populations. We evaluated our pipeline on both simulated and real viral quasispecies data from HIV (and real data from SARS-COV-2). Experimental results show that ViPRA-Haplo, although still an overestimation in the number of true contigs, outperforms the existing tool, PEHaplo, providing up to 9% better genome coverage on HIV real data. In addition, ViPRA-Haplo also retains higher diversity of the viral population as demonstrated by the presence of a higher percentage of contigs less than 1000 base pairs (bps), which also contain k-mers with counts less than 100 (representing rarer sequences), which are absent in PEHaplo. For SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, ViPRA-Haplo reconstructs contigs that cover more than 90% of the reference genome and were able to validate known SARS-CoV-2 strains in the sequencing data.},

We introduce a prototype that segments expert interviews into concise, interconnected video fragments, each augmented with hyperlinked references to related scientific articles, interactive diagrams, and educational resources. This method allows users to navigate content in a personalized, exploratory manner, facilitating deeper engagement with complex topics in computational neuroscience. Detailed metadata annotations and dynamic hyperlinking create a robust network of content, enabling seamless transitions between topics and revisiting previously explored segments. We incorporate game design elements to sustain interest and employ user tracking to personalize content recommendations, enhancing the overall learning experience. This prototype represents a significant advancement in digital media, combining the accessibility of podcasts with the interactivity of hypertext, thus paving the way for more immersive and informative scientific communication.},

abstract = {Sequential recommendation has been receiving increasing attention from researchers. Existing sequential recommendation models leverage deep learning models to capture sequential features. However, these methods ignore confounders in the recommendation process, which can lead the model to learn incorrect correlations and fail to accurately capture users' true preferences. Moreover, these methods rely on extensive interaction sequences, but sequential data often suffers from sparsity issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a &lt;u&gt; P &lt;/u&gt;reference-&lt;u&gt; a &lt;/u&gt;ware &lt;u&gt; C &lt;/u&gt;ausal &lt;u&gt; I &lt;/u&gt;ntervention and Counter&lt;u&gt; f &lt;/u&gt;a&lt;u&gt; c &lt;/u&gt;tual Data Augmentation ( Pacific ) framework to enhance sequential recommendation. Initially, we model the causal graph of sequential recommendation and categorize user preferences into global long-term preferences, local long-term preferences, and short-term preferences. Then, we introduce the front-door criterion to eliminate the interference of confounders and design different self-attention mechanisms to estimate the causal effects, aiming to capture users' true preferences. In addition, based on counterfactual thinking, we design a counterfactual data augmentation module to generate enriched sequences. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.},

Students also indicated a desire for more structured opportunities to connect with peers, and commented positively on current departmental efforts to make our common areas more welcoming.

However, a new optimal solution for the updated problem may be quite different from the existing solution, thereby causing an apathy for its implementation involving large cost, changes, and efforts. For such scenarios, we propose a concept of an "innovation path" (IP) containing a sequence of intermediate solutions from the existing to the new target solution with gradual and controlled change from one to the next. To discover intermediate solutions of the IP simultaneously, we propose a bi-objective formulation of the original problem, so that Pareto-optimal solutions of the resulting bi-objective problem become the IP solutions. We demonstrate the working of the proposed approach on a number of single and two-objective test and engineering problems. Results are encouraging and suggest further research and application to make the proposed innovation path approach more efficient and practical.},

abstract = {Sentiment classification is essential in natural language processing, leveraging machine learning algorithms to understand the sentiment expressed in textual data. Over the years, advancements in machine learning, particularly with Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have tremendously improved sentiment classification. These models benefit from word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec and GloVe, which provide dense vector representations of words, capturing their semantic and syntactic relationships. This paper explores the parallelisation of NB and SVM models using CUDA on GPUs to enhance computational efficiency and performance. Despite the computational power offered by GPUs, the literature on parallelising machine learning methods, especially for sentiment classification, remains limited. Our work aims to fill this gap by comparing the performance of NB and SVM on CPU and GPU platforms, focusing on execution time and model accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that NB outperforms SVM in execution time and overall efficiency, mainly when using GPU acceleration. The NB model consistently achieves higher accuracy, precision, and F1 scores with Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings. The results show the importance of leveraging GPU acceleration using varying numbers of threads per block for large-scale sentiment analysis and laying the foundation for parallelising sentiment classification tasks.},

For data visualization, the CODAP tool developed by the Concord Consortium is utilized, which features an easier drag-and-drop approach to create graphs. Our demonstration will encompass the collection and visualization of environmental data, coding modifications, and hands-on audience participation. Currently implemented in various educational settings, the project has witnessed teachers' growing confidence in its execution and has shown promise in bolstering students' coding skills. For this demo, participants are encouraged to bring their laptops if they wish to create or modify Micro:bit codes to test with our greenhouse setup.},

abstract = {Classifying tissue types in whole slide histological images (WSIs) is a critical task in digital pathology, with significant potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. While traditional patch-based approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown success, they often struggle to capture the spatial and topological relationships inherent in histological structures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel graph-based method leveraging graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) for tissue type classification in WSIs. In our approach, a graph is constructed where nodes represent image patches and edges encode spatial relationships, allowing the network to effectively aggregate information from neighboring patches. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling strategy that selectively builds graphs from annotated regions, improving the model’s ability to utilize spatial dependencies. Evaluations on the free publicly available PATH-DT-MSU dataset reveal that our method achieves a significant improvement in Macro F1-score compared to state-of-the-art patch-based and graph-based methods. These results demonstrate that the proposed GCNN model not only enhances classification accuracy but also provides a more robust framework for addressing the complex spatial structure of histological images.},

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can regulate biological functions by interacting with specific RNAs, and play an important role in many life activities. Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance. The experimental results show that MAHyNet has better performance than other models.},

abstract = {We report a resource estimation pipeline that explicitly compiles quantum circuits expressed using the Clifford+T gate set into a surface code lattice surgery instruction set. The cadence of magic state requests from the compiled circuit enables the optimization of magic state distillation and storage requirements in a post-hoc analysis. To compile logical circuits into lattice surgery operations, we build upon the open-source Lattice Surgery Compiler. The revised compiler operates in two stages: the first translates logical gates into an abstract, layout-independent instruction set; the second compiles these into local lattice surgery instructions that are allocated to hardware tiles according to a specified resource layout. The second stage retains logical parallelism while avoiding resource contention in the fault-tolerant layer, aiding realism. Additionally, users can specify dedicated tiles at which magic states are replenished, enabling resource costs from the logical computation to be considered independently from magic state distillation and storage. We demonstrate the applicability of our pipeline to large practical quantum circuits by providing resource estimates for the ground state estimation of molecules. We find that variable magic state consumption rates in real circuits can cause the resource costs of magic state storage to dominate unless production is varied to suit.},

However, little research examined social learning in esports, over time, in granular detail. Understanding the role of others in the esports learning process has implications for the design of computational support systems that can help esports players learn and make the games more accessible. Therefore, we perform an exploration of this topic using Co-Regulated Learning as a theoretical lens. In doing so, we hope to enrich existing knowledge on social learning in esports, provide insights for the future development of computational support, and a road-map for future work. Through an interview study of an esports community consisting of 14, college-aged, male players, we uncovered 10 themes regarding how Co-Regulated learning occurs within their teams. Based on these, we discuss three main takeaways and their implications for future research and development.},

abstract = {The digital advertising field has always had challenging ML problems, learning from petabytes of data that is highly imbalanced, reactivity times in the milliseconds, and more recently compounded with the complex user's path to purchase across devices, across platforms, and even online/real-world behavior. The AdKDD workshop continues to be a forum for researchers in advertising, during and after KDD. Our website which hosts slides and abstracts receives approximately 2,000 monthly visits and 1,800 active users during the KDD 2021. In surveys during AdKDD 2019 and 2020, over 60% agreed that AdKDD is the reason they attended KDD, and over 90% indicated they would attend next year. The 2024 edition is particularly timely because of the increasing application of Graph-based NN and Generative AI models in advertising. Coupled with privacy-preserving initiatives enforced by GDPR, CCPA the future of computational advertising is at an interesting crossroads. For this edition, we plan to solicit papers that span the spectrum of deep user understanding while remaining privacy-preserving. In addition, we will seek papers that discuss fairness in the context of advertising, to what extent does hyper-personalization work, and whether the ad industry as a whole needs to think through more effective business models such as incrementality. We have hosted several academic and industry luminaries as keynote speakers and have found our invited speaker series hosting expert practitioners to be an audience favorite. We will continue fielding a diverse set of keynote speakers and invited talks for this edition as well. As with past editions, we hope to motivate researchers in this space to think not only about the ML aspects but also to spark conversations about the societal impact of online advertising.},

abstract = {Accurately calculating the electronic structure of strongly correlated chemical systems necessitates a detailed description of both static and dynamical electron correlations, posing a significant challenge in ab initio quantum chemistry. Although the high memory and computational demands generally limit these calculations to relatively modest systems, the advanced computational capabilities of modern GPUs provide new avenues to expand these limits. However, complex control flows inherent to computation notably impair performance on GPUs. Furthermore, the significant disparity in computational load across different branches leads to load imbalance, challenging the large-scale simulations. In this work, we introduce PASCI, a heterogeneous parallel computing framework designed to quickly and efficiently parallelize the computation of dynamical correlation energy based on determinants. The features of the PASCI framework include (1) a divergence-avoiding GPU algorithm, (2) a three-level load-mapping strategy to ensure load balance across processors, GPU warps, and GPU threads, (3) performance models for memory footprint and computation, and (4) seamless integration with existing quantum chemistry software. Experimental results using an NVIDIA A100 GPU demonstrate that our new GPU algorithm achieves an average 6.6x (up to 13.8x) peak performance increase and 2-4 orders of magnitude speedup in practical usage compared to its original GPU implementation. Moreover, PASCI exhibits excellent scalability, highlighting its potential as a powerful high-performance computing tool in complex quantum chemistry research.},

abstract = {We study the complexity of memory checkers with computational security and prove the first general tight lower bound. Memory checkers, first introduced over 30 years ago by Blum, Evans, Gemmel, Kannan, and Naor (FOCS ’91, Algorithmica ’94), allow a user to store and maintain a large memory on a remote and unreliable server by using small trusted local storage. The user can issue instructions to the server and after every instruction, obtain either the correct value or a failure (but not an incorrect answer) with high probability. The main complexity measure of interest is the size of the local storage and the number of queries the memory checker makes upon every logical instruction. The most efficient known construction has query complexity O(log n/log log n) and local space proportional to a computational security parameter, assuming one-way functions, where n is the logical memory size. Dwork, Naor, Rothblum, and Vaikuntanathan (TCC ’09) showed that for a restricted class of “deterministic and non-adaptive” memory checkers, this construction is optimal, up to constant factors. However, going beyond the small class of deterministic and non-adaptive constructions has remained a major open problem. In this work, we fully resolve the complexity of memory checkers by showing that any construction with local space p and query complexity q must satisfy 
[ 
p ge frac{n}{(log n)^{O(q)}} ;.
]
This implies, as a special case, that q ≥ Ω(log n/log log n) in any scheme, assuming that p ≤ n1 − ε for ε &gt; 0. The bound applies to any scheme with computational security, completeness 2/3, and inverse polynomial in n soundness (all of which make our lower bound only stronger). We further extend the lower bound to schemes where the read complexity qr and write complexity qw differ. For instance, we show the tight bound that if qr = O(1) and p ≤ n1 − ε for ε &gt; 0, then qw ≥ nΩ(1). This is the first lower bound, for any non-trivial class of constructions, showing a read-write query complexity trade-off. Our proof is via a delicate compression argument showing that a “too good to be true” memory checker can be used to compress random bits of information. We draw inspiration from tools recently developed for lower bounds for relaxed locally decodable codes. However, our proof itself significantly departs from these works, necessitated by the differences between settings.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is revolutionising drug discovery by expediting the prediction of small molecule properties essential for developing new drugs. These properties - including absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) - are crucial in the early stages of drug development since they provide an understanding of the course of the drug in the organism, i.e., the drug's pharmacokinetics. However, existing methods lack personalisation and rely on manually crafted ML algorithms or pipelines, which can introduce inefficiencies and biases into the process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel evolutionary-based automated ML method (AutoML) specifically designed for predicting small molecule properties, with a particular focus on pharmacokinetics. Leveraging the advantages of grammar-based genetic programming, our AutoML method streamlines the process by automatically selecting algorithms and designing predictive pipelines tailored to the particular characteristics of input molecular data. Results demonstrate AutoML's effectiveness in selecting diverse ML algorithms, resulting in comparable or even improved predictive performances compared to conventional approaches. By offering personalised ML-driven pipelines, our method promises to enhance small molecule research in drug discovery, providing researchers with a valuable tool for accelerating the development of novel therapeutic drugs.},

abstract = {Concurrency is challenging to learn and to teach. In prior work, researchers focused on student solutions to concurrency-related problems. In this work, we focus on student process in solving concurrent programming problems. We conducted a reflexive, thematic analysis of CS students as they solved a concurrent programming problem during a 3.5 hour final exam with a problem description that included function prototypes, example output, and features of correctness. We collected screen recordings, audio recordings and code solutions. Our thematic analysis of the process data identified several themes in student reasoning in this context. Notably, we found that most students focused heavily on emulating the example output. Thus we developed a theme of student reliance on example output and program output. Students’ focus on the ordering seen in the example output was associated with and appeared to trigger sequentialist reasoning about the problem. The single example output was used as a ground truth despite the labeling of the output as “one example output” and students’ prior expressed knowledge of the irreproducibility of output in a non-deterministic program. Students then used program output as the key indicator of success, leading to rapid cycles of edits and output checks. As a result, students produced solutions that restricted concurrency (e.g., excessive blocking, batching of simulation steps) or violated some aspect of the problem statement. This paper describes the data collected, the context in which it was collected, evidence of student reasoning, impacts on solution, and how students used provided materials. We discuss our findings in the context of prior work that focused on student solutions and describe the need for pedagogical interventions that provide students with a sense of progress and encourage self-efficacy. Finally, we make recommendations for pedagogical interventions that may better promote concurrency-related modeling and efficient solutions.},

abstract = {The whole-slide images (WSIs) examination of skin biopsy is the golden standard for pathological diagnosis of most skin diseases. However, the restricted computational resources limit the clinical applications of the large repositories of WSIs. Here, we presented a machine learning framework for WSI analysis in dermatology named PathoEye, which overcomes these limitations in WSI applications. We demonstrated that PathoEye can quantitatively measure the epidermis thickness, and the variance of rete ridge length decreases during skin aging. Then, the established classification models using PathoEye successfully discriminate the young and aged skin tissues. Interestingly, defects in dermis-epidermis junctional (DEJ) areas, also called basement membrane zone (BMZ), were found in the aged group compared with the young group. Further experimental analysis showed that the senescence cells were enriched in BMZ, and the turnover rate of the basement membrane (BM) components is delayed in aged skin, including COL17A1, COL4A2, and ITGA6. In summary, PathoEye successfully extracts the features of skin structure and components in WSIs. It also provides a comprehensive tool to characterize the unique features of different skin conditions associated with BMZ, ensuring its potential applications in skin disease diagnosis and treatment planning.},

abstract = {Approximately 43.4 million people in the United States are native Spanish speakers, accounting for 13.7% of the population. Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States, only behind English. Cognitive load affects how much information can be moved into and from our working memory. When students are unable to lessen their cognitive load, it is impossible or almost impossible for them to continue learning. Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy is a free Python curriculum and professional development project that offers Spanish as a toggleable option so that students have it easily accessible to them when/if needed [1]. We use translanguaging and cognitive load theories in the development of the curriculum translation [2].In addition to the translation, all supporting materials are also available in Spanish, allowing teaching and learning in either Spanish or English. We have pilots running in Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Puerto Rico, and Mexico, where every year, more teachers and students benefit from the Spanish-language translation of the curriculum.Since the beginning of Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy in 2018 and launch of Spanish in 2021, the project has gone from 90 active daily Spanish users to over 2600 active daily users and has seen a doubling of users yearly. The goal for the 2024-2025 school year is to reach a total of 6000 daily users and launch additional pilots in Latin America.},

abstract = {New breakthroughs in code synthesis from Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model (LLM) algorithms are driving significant changes to software engineering education. Having algorithms able to generate components of a software project means that software developers will need stronger skills in requirements specification to guide code generation as well as stronger skills in code review, testing, and integration to incorporate AI-generated code into projects. Shifts in industry and classroom practices are already occurring with the availability of inline code generation tools like GitHub's Copilot, which makes discussion of pedagogical strategies in this area a timely topic. Of immediate concern in computer science education is the potential for LLM-generated code and code help to undermine the learning of CS students. In order to avoid such undermining in even intentional uses of LLM-enhanced learning supports, it is necessary to clarify the roles such supports need to play in the pedagogical process. The Computer Science Matrix Taxonomy provides a strong framework for organizing software testing learning outcomes as well as delineating the operational space in which LLM-based feedback tools should operate to support those learning outcomes. In this paper, the authors operationalize the CS Matrix Taxonomy for software testing learning outcomes and illustrate the integration of LLM-generated test strategy suggestions as an extension of the peer coding/testing model. The work includes examples of AI-generated code testing suggestions that students would use to help guide their own code synthesis for assignments or projects.},

abstract = {In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering significant improvements for extracting complex information from biomedical literature. Our research introduces a novel metaphor-based approach, MetaphorPrompt, to enhance the accuracy of extracting molecular regulatory pathways (MRPs) from biomedical texts. This method employs LLMs such as GPT4 to develop metaphors that map biological processes onto familiar, real-world scenarios, facilitating a better understanding and extracting causal events in MRPs. MetaphorPrompt is tested using the reguloGPT dataset and compared to a baseline method (without metaphors) and reguloGPT's best prompt. Test results demonstrate improved precision, recall, and F1 scores in node and edge prediction of causal event links through analogical reasoning. The effect of in-context learning (ICL) in MetaphorPrompt is investigated, and it is found that analogical reasoning offers significant improvements over ICL. This supports the claim that LLMs can perform novel problem-solving through analogical reasoning. This work paves the way for more intuitive and user-friendly representations of MRPs in biomedical data, ultimately contributing to advancements in biomedical NLP, knowledge graph construction, and effective applications of LLMs in novel problem-solving through analogical reasoning.},

A powerful method to obtain polynomial-time tractability results for such CSPs is a certain reduction to polynomial-time tractable finite-domain CSPs defined over k-types, for a sufficiently large k. We give sufficient conditions when this method can be applied and apply these conditions to obtain a new complexity dichotomy for CSPs of first-order expansions of the basic relations of the well-studied spatial reasoning formalism RCC5. We also classify which of these CSPs can be expressed in Datalog. Our method relies on Ramsey theory; we prove that RCC5 has a Ramsey order expansion.},

abstract = {Student engagement has been shown to increase academic achievement. We apply learning engagement strategies in introductory computer science courses using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones. Using programming to control and fly drones reinforces the basic concepts of programming in an interesting and enjoyable way for first year programming students in a CS1 course. Additionally, we apply similar but less technical engagement strategies in a general education course with no prerequisites, and engage students with issues in modern technology through the medium of drones. Many in higher education see the introduction of complex topics as an important method of engaging students and therefore of improving learning outcomes. This leads many to offer courses in areas like robotics, AI, and game development. A potential problem with this approach is the level of knowledge required for these courses precludes their use as an engagement strategy in introductory coursework where they might attract the attention of a broader set of students. To this end we looked into adding drone technology to introductory and non-major CS courses. While preliminary, these results suggest a high level of student interest in the topic and promising engagement from both CS major and non-CS-major students.},

Since 2018, this project has been globally available and has worked with professors, teachers, and content developers to create multiple courses: a short introductory course, the flagship CS1 year-long course, a college-level course, and more. Courses are offered through our online, web-based platform, which is free to use by teachers in K-12 classrooms. The goal is to bridge knowledge from block-based curriculum to text-based college-level courses. In addition, our college-level course allows students to earn credit (four credit hours/12 units) for their work through an end-of-course exam proctored by teachers in their schools. Currently in its first-year post-pilot, College Programming and Computer Science (CPCS) has allowed students to earn Carnegie Mellon University credit that is recognized at universities across the United States and beyond.Carnegie Mellon University's CS Academy has served over 450,000 students and 13,000 teachers worldwide.

While this has often resulted in ethics ''add-ons'' to otherwise technical coursework (Saltz et al., 2019), we present a different approach: we have designed an online learning experience for high school-aged youth that directly integrates AI technical learning with attention to the ethical issues particular AI systems raise. Specifically, we have adopted a socio-technical approach to lesson design where we ground learning experiences in resonant contexts for youth that foster understating about how human and technical decisions (e.g., about what data sets are selected, or how bias is mitigated) can contribute to the ethics of how AI systems operate. To support this design goal, we formed a youth advisory group to identify resonant contexts and better understand the issues and concerns youth have about AI. For this presentation, we will discuss our design and its grounding principles, how the youth advisory group helped shape our current approach, and discuss lessons learned from our iterative design-based research. We will also discuss our efforts at creating a pro-social space for the online learning experience, challenges we've encountered, and how we've tried to address them.

abstract = {In clinical practice, the accurate assessment of patient response to drugs is crucial for personalized treatment. Research has demonstrated that alterations in genomic profiles can significantly influence the efficacy of cancer therapies. Studies of cancer drug sensitivity have the potential to predict heterogeneous cell line responses to various drugs, facilitate drug screening processes, and identify new biomarkers for sensitive populations[3]. Unlike traditional documentation of patient drug responses, cancer pharmacogenomics research has established a comprehensive database of in vitro cultured cell lines, encompassing genomic data across multiple modalities, including gene expression, mutation, copy number variation, and methylation patterns[1]. Recent investigations have confirmed that incorporating information from diverse genomic modalities can yield a wide range of biological insights that enhance the predictive modeling capabilities of drug responses[2]. However, access to paired genomic data remains challenging within practical clinical settings, which limits the application of high-performance multi-modal models.In this work, we propose a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework. During the training phase, we utilize multi-modal data from an open database and subsequently transfer the acquired multi-modal genomic knowledge to an unimodal network. Only gene expression data is required for inference. This approach not only preserves the knowledge of the multi-modal ensemble, but also reduces the computational cost during the inference phase. Different from previous multi-modal networks that only focus on feature fusion within the hidden space, we emphasize the correlation modeling between multi-modal genomes during the fusion phase. During knowledge distillation, we implement inter-sample relation alignment to facilitate efficient information transfer.Experimental results show that our unimodal inference model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable performance to our optimized multi-modal model. The validation on real clinical data also demonstrates that our method can achieve accurate response prediction when only gene expression is available, indicating the generalization of the model in real-world applications. At the same time, fine-tuning our model on independent cell line data that are not identically distributed can achieve faster convergence and higher inference accuracy than random initialization and baselines.},

abstract = {In the realm of high-dimensional single-cell sequencing data analysis, the accurate measurement of similarity between cells is pivotal. However, conventional metrics like Euclidean distance after L1-normalization may fail by losing distinguishable information when handling high-dimensional data, where the distance between different observations gradually converges to a shrinking interval. In this article, we discuss the influence of normalization by different p-norms and the defect of Euclidean distance. We discover that observation differences are better preserved when normalizing data by a higher p-norm and using geodesic distance rather than Euclidean distance as the similarity measurement. We further identify that L2-normalization onto the hypersphere is often sufficient in preserving delicate differences even in relatively high dimensional data while maintaining computational efficiency. Subsequently, we present HS-SNE (HyperSphere-SNE), a hypersphere-representation-system-based augmentation to t-SNE, which effectively addresses the intricacy of high-dimensional data visualization and similarity measurement. Our results on multiple single-cell sequencing datasets show that this hypersphere representation system has improved resolution to identify more subtle differences between high-dimensional data points, while balancing information preservation and computational efficiency. The implementation of HS-SNE is available at https://github.com/zqrong/HS-SNE.},

abstract = {Text simplification refers to the process of increasing the comprehensibility of texts. Automatic text simplification models are most commonly evaluated by experts or crowdworkers instead of the primary target groups of simplified texts, such as persons with intellectual disabilities. We conducted an evaluation study of text comprehensibility including participants with and without intellectual disabilities reading unsimplified, automatically and manually simplified German texts on a tablet computer. We explored four different approaches to measuring comprehensibility: multiple-choice comprehension questions, perceived difficulty ratings, response time, and reading speed. The results revealed significant variations in these measurements, depending on the reader group and whether the text had undergone automatic or manual simplification. For the target group of persons with intellectual disabilities, comprehension questions emerged as the most reliable measure, while analyzing reading speed provided valuable insights into participants’ reading behavior.},

abstract = {Cai and Hemachandra used iterative constant-setting to prove that Few ⊆ ⊕ P (and thus that Few P ⊆ ⊕P). In this article, we note that there is a tension between the nondeterministic ambiguity of the class one is seeking to capture, and the density (or, to be more precise, the needed “nongappiness”) of the easy-to-find “targets” used in iterative constant-setting. In particular, we show that even less restrictive gap-size upper bounds regarding the targets allow one to capture ambiguity-limited classes. Through a flexible, metatheorem-based approach, we do so for a wide range of classes including the logarithmic-ambiguity version of Valiant’s unambiguous nondeterminism class UP. Our work lowers the bar for what advances regarding the existence of infinite, P-printable sets of primes would suffice to show that restricted counting classes based on the primes have the power to accept superconstant-ambiguity analogues of UP. As an application of our work, we prove that the Lenstra–Pomerance–Wagstaff Conjecture implies that all  ((mathcal {O}(1) + log log n)) -ambiguity NP sets are in the restricted counting class RCPRIMES.},

abstract = {Accurately identifying conformational B-cell epitopes, which involve complex protein structures, is essential in modern immunology and vaccine development. Traditional methods like X-ray crystallography provide precise data but are costly and time-consuming. This has led to the rise of computational methods, especially deep learning algorithms, which offer more efficient and cost-effective solutions. A major challenge in predicting conformational epitopes based on structure is the limited availability of experimentally validated structural data. Structural prediction tools can help address this issue but still rely on provided sequence information and complex algorithms, which can introduce noise and affect accuracy. Moreover, effectively aligning and fusing structural features with evolutionary sequence information remains another challenge. To address these challenges, we introduce AlphaEpi, an innovative model that combines the advanced structure prediction capabilities of AlphaFold 3 with deep learning graph neural networks. Additionally, we propose for the first time a dynamic selector module that allows the model to adjust its processing strategy based on the reliability of the structure and sequence information, addressing the challenge posed by unreliable structural data. Moreover, a novel graph fusion module integrates structural and evolutionary information, effectively solving the disparities in the integration process of structure and sequence data. Results show that by integrating advanced structural prediction technologies AlphaFold 3 with deep learning graph neural networks, AlphaEpi significantly surpasses baseline results, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art. This advancement furthers the development of B-cell epitope prediction and has significant implications for biological research.},

abstract = {Tumor detection and subtyping remain a significant challenge in histopathology image analysis. As digital pathology progresses, the applications of deep learning become essential. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has emerged as a crucial task in digital pathology, vital for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, we introduce an innovative abnormal-guided Multiple Foundation Model Fusion (MFMF) framework, aimed at enhancing WSI classification by integrating multi-level information from pathology images with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Traditional methods often focus on patch-level features while neglecting the rich contextual and morphological details at the cell and text levels, thus failing to fully exploit the multidimensional nature of WSIs. Our method enhances traditional models by efficiently integrating patch-level, cell-level, and text-level features using three foundation models. These are then fused through a novel three-step cross-attention module that effectively leverages cell and text information with patch-level features. Furthermore, unlike most studies that use attention scores to select instances based on the assumption that high scores indicate the presence of a tumor, we design an abnormality-aware module to naturally identify and detect abnormal features (i.e., tumors) as the criteria for selecting important instances, thereby reducing computational costs and boosting overall performance. We validate our approach against leading benchmarks on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-Lung datasets, achieving superior classification performance. Our study not only tackles the challenges of sparsity and noise in multi-level features but also enhances the efficiency and accuracy of WSI classification by exploiting abnormal features.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in numerous natural language processing tasks, particularly in generative tasks. Nevertheless, their performance in non-generative tasks, such as information extraction, especially within specialized domain-specific extraction tasks like Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER), has been less successful when applied in an unsupervised manner. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from the chain-of-thought concept and adopt a two-step approach for NER using LLMs: entity span extraction and entity type determination. Additionally, we introduce a framework for incorporating domain-specific entity knowledge to mitigate the LLM's inherent lack of domain expertise during entity category determination. Experimental results from four biomedical NER datasets illustrate a significant improvement in our approach when compared to prior LLM-based methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves results on par with other few-shot methods using just one shot, in contrast to their requirement of 50 shots.},

We discover that CharacterMeet facilitates iterative character construction. Specifically, participants, including those with more linear usual approaches, alternated between writing and personalized exploration through visualization of ideas on CharacterMeet while visuals and audio enhanced immersion. Our findings support research on iterative creative processes and the growing potential of personalizable generative AI creativity support tools.

Our study employed advanced fine-tuning methodologies on open-sourced LLMs, applying textual data mining techniques to automate the knowledge discovery and synthesis phases of an SLR process, thus demonstrating a practical and efficient approach for extracting and analyzing high-quality information from large academic datasets. The results maintained high fidelity in factual accuracy in LLM responses, and were validated through the replication of an existing PRISMA-conforming SLR. Our research proposed solutions for mitigating LLM hallucination and proposed mechanisms for tracking LLM responses to their sources of information, thus demonstrating how this approach can meet the rigorous demands of scholarly research. The findings ultimately confirmed the potential of fine-tuned LLMs in streamlining various labour-intensive processes of conducting literature reviews. As a scalable proof-of-concept, this study highlights the broad applicability of our approach across multiple research domains. The potential demonstrated here advocates for updates to PRISMA reporting guidelines, incorporating AI-driven processes to ensure methodological transparency and reliability in future SLRs.

CACTUS achieves this by providing additional support for categorical attributes, preserving their original meaning, optimising memory usage, and speeding up the computation through parallelisation.

abstract = {This paper explores the zero-shot reasoning abilities of three popular LLMs from the point of view of fuzzy logic. Unlike strict logical reasoning, fuzzy reasoning allows for the case when a logically incorrect conclusion is still plausible (given additional context). This form of reasoning is more similar to typical human discourse rather than strict logical inference.Given that previous studies have shown the equivalence of likelihoods and membership functions, we use likelihoods (output by LLMs) to score their performance on a variety of reasoning tasks. Specifically, we use a recent logic dataset for this purpose but modify the prompts to encourage the LLM to output likelihood values for multiple choice and yes/no questions. We show that two versions of GPT (3.5 Turbo and 4.0125) perform very well on average (scoring 0.813 and 0.761 respectively) while Gemini-1.5 Pro struggles (scoring 0.635), particular on yes/no questions. We explore the reason for this difference. It appears that since Gemini is a multi-modal model, its logical reasoning abilities are not as fully developed as the two GPT models.},

abstract = {We study the complexity of memory checkers with computational security and prove the first general tight lower bound. Memory checkers, first introduced over 30 years ago by Blum, Evans, Gemmel, Kannan, and Naor (FOCS ’91, Algorithmica ’94), allow a user to store and maintain a large memory on a remote and unreliable server by using small trusted local storage. The user can issue instructions to the server and after every instruction, obtain either the correct value or a failure (but not an incorrect answer) with high probability. The main complexity measure of interest is the size of the local storage and the number of queries the memory checker makes upon every logical instruction. The most efficient known construction has query complexity O(logn/loglogn) and local space proportional to a computational security parameter, assuming one-way functions, where n is the logical memory size. Dwork, Naor, Rothblum, and Vaikuntanathan (TCC ’09) showed that for a restricted class of “deterministic and non-adaptive” memory checkers, this construction is optimal, up to constant factors. However, going beyond the small class of deterministic and non-adaptive constructions has remained a major open problem. In this work, we fully resolve the complexity of memory checkers by showing that any construction with local space p and query complexity q must satisfy p ≥ n/(logn)O(q)  . This implies, as a special case, that q≥ Ω(logn/loglogn) in any scheme, assuming that p≤ n1−ε for ε&gt;0. The bound applies to any scheme with computational security, completeness 2/3, and inverse polynomial in n soundness (all of which make our lower bound only stronger). We further extend the lower bound to schemes where the read complexity qr and write complexity qw differ. For instance, we show the tight bound that if qr=O(1) and p≤ n1−ε for ε&gt;0, then qw≥ nΩ(1). This is the first lower bound, for any non-trivial class of constructions, showing a read-write query complexity trade-off. Our proof is via a delicate compression argument showing that a “too good to be true” memory checker can be used to compress random bits of information. We draw inspiration from tools recently developed for lower bounds for relaxed locally decodable codes. However, our proof itself significantly departs from these works, necessitated by the differences between settings.},

We thus propose a new probabilistic temporal logic over finite traces using superposition semantics, where all possible evolutions are possible, until observed. We study the properties of the logic and provide automata-based mechanisms for deriving probabilistic inferences from its formulas. We then study a fragment of the logic with better computational properties. Notably, formulas in this fragment can be discovered from event log data using off-the-shelf existing declarative process discovery techniques.},

abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of applying the notion of cosmotechnics —the concept that advocates for reciprocal relations between technology and local cultural and ecological contexts—in the field of Digital Musical Instruments (DMI) design. We present zhu nao, a DMI that takes inspiration from traditional and contemporary culture of China, as a research probe to investigate how locality (one of the key ideas of cosmotechnical thought) is inscribed in musical instruments by designers and perceived by players. Our study involved ten participants from diverse backgrounds engaging with zhu nao. We aimed not to evaluate the instrument per se, but rather to understand how its design, rooted in specific cultural and environmental considerations, resonates with players. The findings reveal that zhu nao evoked a spectrum of personal and cultural associations, highlighting the rich potential of incorporating cosmotechnical approaches into DMI design. This work contributes to the discourse on technodiversity in music technology, suggesting new pathways for creating instruments that deeply resonate with players and their cultural landscapes.},

abstract = {There has been growing interest across CS education for evidence-based instructional strategies that improve learning and retention. Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is one such strategy with a proven history across STEM disciplines. The CS POGIL community has grown rapidly over the past decade thanks to NSF support of multiple grants of educational research in Computer Science using this strategy; hundreds of CS teachers and professors have attended POGIL workshops to learn more about using and developing POGIL materials. A survey of CS POGIL practitioners found that instructors believe their students learn more, are more engaged and active, and develop better communication skills in POGIL classrooms [1]. The survey also found that obstacles include limited time, a lack of relevant materials, pressure to cover content, difficulty adapting teaching style, and resistance from students. Workshops like this one can help practitioners to answer these questions and to adopt POGIL more effectively and efficiently. This workshop is based on materials developed and used extensively by The POGIL Project (http://pogil.org).},

abstract = {When encoding real numbers as (necessarily infinite) bit-strings, the na\"{\i}ve binary/decimal expansion is well-known []computably “unreasonable”, rendering, for example, tripling qualitatively discontinuous on Cantor’s sequence space. Encoding reals as sequences of (finite integer numerators and denominators, in binary, of) rational approximations does make common operations qualitatively computable, yet admits no bounds on their computational complexity/quantitative continuity. Dyadic approximations, on the other hand, are known polynomially, and signed binary expansions even linearly, “reasonable” in a rigorous sense recalled in the introduction of this work. But how to distinguish between un/suitable encodings of spaces common in Calculus beyond the reals, such as Banach or Sobolev?With respect to qualitative computability/continuity on topological spaces, the technical condition of admissibility had been identified [] for an encoding over Cantor space (historically called a representation) to be “reasonable” []. Roughly speaking, admissibility requires the representation to be (i) continuous, and to be (ii) maximal with respect to continuous reduction. Admissible representations exist for a large class of spaces. And for (precisely) these does the Kreitz–Weihrauch—sometimes aka Main—Theorem of Computable Analysis hold, which characterizes continuity of functions by continuity of mappings translating codes, so-called realizers.We refine qualitative computability/continuity on topological spaces to quantitative continuity/complexity on metric spaces by proposing a notion, and investigating the properties, of polynomially/linearly admissible representations. Roughly speaking, these are (i) close to “optimally” continuous, namely linearly/polynomially relative to the space’s entropy, and they are (ii) maximal with respect to relative linear/polynomial quantitatively continuous reductions defined in the main text.Quantitatively admissible representations are closed under composition over generalized ground spaces beyond Cantor’s. Such representations exhibit a quantitative strengthening of the qualitative Main Theorem, namely now characterizing quantitative continuity of functions by quantitative continuity of realizers. A large class of compact metric spaces is shown to admit polynomially admissible representations over compact ultrametric spaces, and some even a generalization of the linearly admissible signed binary encoding. Quantitative admissibility thus provides the desired criterion for complexity-theoretically “reasonable” encodings.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models due to their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, our goal is to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of using a causality-based approach for fMRI fingerprinting. Specifically, we propose an innovative method that utilizes the causal dynamics activities of the brain to identify the unique cognitive patterns of individuals (e.g., subject fingerprint) and fMRI tasks (e.g., task fingerprint). The key novelty of our approach stems from the development of a two-timescale linear state-space model to extract 'spatio-temporal' (aka causal) signatures from an individual's fMRI time series data. To the best of our knowledge, we pioneer and subsequently quantify, in this paper, the concept of 'causal fingerprint.' Our method is well-separated from other fingerprint studies as we quantify fingerprints from a cause-and-effect perspective, which are then incorporated with a modal decomposition and projection method to perform subject identification and a GNN-based (Graph Neural Network) model to perform task identification. Finally, we show that the experimental results and comparisons with non-causality-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We visualize the obtained causal signatures and discuss their biological relevance in light of the existing understanding of brain functionalities. Collectively, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.},

We discuss how young learners can acquire AI literacy skills related to the practical application, technical understanding, and critical appraisal of AI. We conceptualise a hands-on workshop on understanding how computers can be taught through programming and machine learning for learners without prior knowledge. We evaluate participants’ AI literacy quantitatively and qualitatively and find a large variance in interest, understanding, and knowledge in the relatively homogeneous groups. Our findings suggest that elementary school learners can understand basic machine learning concepts and gain ethical considerations, including data quality and bias. Given the importance of early AI education, the workshop concept can be implemented by teachers without formal computer science training, addressing the current limitation in AI education in elementary schools.},

We introduce a novel approach using the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark to evaluate the inference and contextual understanding abilities of LLMs in a process-centric manner, focusing on three key components from the Language of Thought Hypothesis (LoTH): Logical Coherence, Compositionality, and Productivity. Our carefully designed experiments reveal that while LLMs demonstrate some inference capabilities, they still significantly lag behind human-level reasoning in these three aspects. The main contribution of this paper lies in introducing the LoTH perspective, which provides a method for evaluating the reasoning process that conventional results-oriented approaches fail to capture, thereby offering new insights into the development of human-level reasoning in artificial intelligence systems.},

abstract = {Mathematics forms the foundation of computer science. By applying mathematical concepts to computer science, students can gain a deeper appreciation for the significance of mathematics and become more engaged in the learning process. This paper explores how integrating data science and AI fairness concepts into two distinct mathematics courses—Discrete Math and Algebra 1—enhances student learning and engagement. In Discrete Math, an upper-level course focusing on discrete mathematical structures, data science applications provide concrete examples of abstract concepts. For instance, recommendation systems and their fairness can be used to motivate graph theory. Similarly, in Algebra 1, a foundational course for future mathematics study, AI fairness problems offer real-world contexts for algebraic concepts. Students can explore linear equations and inequalities by examining AI decision-making processes and their potential biases. By incorporating these data science and AI fairness elements, we transform potentially abstract or mundane mathematical activities into meaningful, relevant learning experiences. This approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts but also introduces students to critical ethical considerations in technology.},

It explores the impact of collective intelligence, geographical information systems, and cognitive systems as a way of supporting the decision-making of local governments (municipalities) to face the challenges announced by the UN in the Urban Agenda 2017. This methodology employs an exploratory approach using the participatory action research method. The model was tested in three municipalities in Ecuador using a technological and collaborative platform called Cognitive Urban Planning (PUC). The results highlighted improvements in the decision-making process in urban planning, since the interactive participation processes through the PUC allowed for the suggestion of a group of strategies for an emerging neighborhood plan developed with the citizens working together in the municipality in real-time. In conclusion, the effects of the decision-making plan could be applied to improve and enhance community participation through city co-creation, supporting the decision-making process of municipalities in a way that promotes inclusive urban planning and stakeholders' awareness, as the recommended plans are supported by the desires and needs raised by citizens.},

abstract = {The Philippines' K-12 education began in 2013 under President Benigno Aquino III to meet global standards and offer a more comprehensive education. The STEM track in Senior High School (SHS) emphasizes science, technology, engineering, and mathematics but faces challenges in effective implementation within the K-12 curriculum in the Philippines. School administrators should regularly evaluate the K12 STEM curriculum to ensure alignment with international standards and students' scientific literacy (Rogayan, 2021).This study aimed to (1) assess the Scientific Literacy of K-12 STEM curriculum graduates through the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills and Scientific Reasoning (TOSLS:SR) (2) describe the implementation of the STEM curriculum through the students’ perceptions of their teachers, school administrators and school resources and facilities and, (3) elucidate the affordances and challenges in learning as experienced by the Grade 12 STEM student graduates using the Curriculum Implementation Survey (CIS). This study utilized the descriptive quantitative research design with the use of online survey questionnaires through Google Forms to assess the scientific literacy of K-12 STEM curriculum graduates through the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills and Scientific Reasoning. Graduates of K-12 STEM from 5 different institutions were targeted as respondents. One hundred sixty-five (165) graduates answered the Test of Scientific Literacy Skills and Scientific Reasoning while one hundred eighty-one (181) graduates answered the curriculum implementation survey. Quantitative data were computed using Jamovi Cloud. Results showed that mastered 7 out of 9 scientific literacy skills in the TOSLS. In the CIS, the mean of the overall responses is approximately 3.485, indicating a generally positive perception of the teachers' capabilities and attitudes towards science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Moreover, the weighted mean of 3.44 indicates a generally positive perception of the school facilities for STEM education. In conclusion, among 5 different institutions included in this study, the implementation of STEM curriculum elicited a positive response from the STEM Curriculum graduates.CCS CONCEPTS • Social and professional topics • Social and professional topics∼K-12 education},

During the interaction design, it is important to have a thoroughgoing knowledge of what the user wants, which might be difficult to gather or portrait to others somehow. In this sense, EMs provide a visual representation of the user's information, attitude, and behavior. Nevertheless, creating such EMs can become tedious, as this usually requires the involvement of a group of people, with expert knowledge, in-deep analyzing the information elicited from the user. In this paper, we present a tool for the automatic generation of EMs. This comprises a web tool aimed to automatically generate an Empathy Map from an audio interview with the user by using machine learning technology. More specifically, this paper reports on the architecture, a use case, and a validation with numerical evidence to corroborate the feasibility of the proposal presented.},

abstract = {About 15 years ago, education researchers conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on change strategies for improving undergraduate STEM education instruction. Analyzing 191 articles from 1995 to 2008, the researchers identified four broad categories of change strategies through a comprehensive interdisciplinary literature review: (1) disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, (2) developing reflective teachers, (3) enacting policy, and (4) developing a shared vision. With recent developments in STEM education practices, it is imperative to conduct a follow-up SLR comparing the effects of change strategies and associated student success. Similarly, with the influx of scientific articles published in recent decades, it is time consuming to conduct comprehensive SLRs without the assistance of machine learning (ML) analysis techniques. Working with qualitative researchers, we investigate the impact and ability of using ML to assist in these analyses. While most ML approaches can be easily written with a few lines of code, using them to extract meaningful information for literature reviews is challenging. In this work, we describe our experience with integrating machine learning techniques into the analysis pipeline of SLRs. Specifically, this poster will: (1) share results from clustering analysis to identify themes of the chosen abstracts, (2) explore the effects of data bias on found clusters, (3) present the challenges of adding machine learning into SLRs, and (4) assess if the addition of ML in SLRs aligns with the expected goals of qualitative researchers.},

abstract = {Constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) encompass an enormous variety of computational problems. In particular, all partition functions from statistical physics, such as spin systems, are special cases of counting CSP (#CSP). We prove a complete complexity classification for every counting problem in #CSP with nonnegative valued constraint functions that is valid when every variable occurs a bounded number of times in all constraints. We show that, depending on the set of constraint functions ℱ, every problem in the complexity class #CSP(ℱ) defined by ℱ is either polynomial-time computable for all instances without the bounded occurrence restriction, or is #P-hard even when restricted to bounded degree input instances. The constant bound in the degree depends on ℱ. The dichotomy criterion on ℱ is decidable. As a second contribution, we prove a slightly modified but more streamlined decision procedure (from [14]) to test for the tractability of #CSP(ℱ). This procedure on an input ℱ tells us which case holds in the dichotomy for #CSP(ℱ). This more streamlined decision procedure enables us to fully classify a family of directed weighted graph homomorphism problems. This family contains both P-time tractable problems and #P-hard problems. To our best knowledge, this is the first family of such problems explicitly classified that are not acyclic, thereby the Lov\'{a}sz-goodness criterion of Dyer-Goldberg-Paterson&nbsp;[24] cannot be applied.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference is a probabilistic approach to the problem of drawing conclusions from observed data. Its main challenge is computational, which the Bayesian community tends to address through approximation techniques. However, these techniques come with their own set of challenges, including approximation errors, the difficulty of assessing these errors, and the inherited NP-hardness of the inference problem. Concurrently, in an effort to keep up with Moore’s law, the computer engineering community has developed an increasing number of programming techniques for today’s heterogeneous hardware. These techniques aim to optimize the execution schedule, which refers to the order and mapping of computations on the available execution units. In this work, we advocate for the utilization of these techniques to avoid a common pitfall known as premature approximation. Notably, these techniques have the potential to significantly enhance performance, thereby reducing the need for approximation and thus mitigating the challenges that accompany it. We first demonstrate how optimization of the storage strategy, i.e., when and where intermediate results are stored, allows for a trade-off between runtime and peak memory usage. We then investigate various techniques that aim to automatically generate efficient execution schedules. Finally, we focus on a specific, runtime-efficient execution schedule identified through design space exploration and compare its performance with that of two established solvers for probabilistic inference. The results show that our optimized implementation achieves speedups ranging from  (2times)  to  (316times)  for the UAI 2014 Promedus benchmark problems compared to the reference solvers. The ideas and methods presented in our study are examined within the framework of exact inference for discrete random variables. However, they are effectively applicable to scenarios involving continuous variables.},

In particular, we focus on the distributed storage of the result vector in cases where it becomes too large to be stored fully on each process, and its redistribution between the iterations of a sequence of SpMV operations. We propose two methods to this effect; one aims at minimizing the memory requirements of storing the result vector, the other optimizes the communications required for the redistribution. We perform large-scale experiments on the Fugaku supercomputer, in order to show the importance of taking into account the network topology to correctly identify and address communication bottlenecks. The results show that the most efficient proposed method has a runtime several times faster than a non-optimal one on this topology.},

abstract = {Recent efforts to connect builders to digital designs during construction have primarily focused on visual augmented reality, which requires accurate registration and specific lighting, and which could prevent a user from noticing safety hazards. Haptic interfaces, on the other hand, can convey physical design parameters through tangible local cues that don’t distract from the surroundings. We propose two edge-changing haptic devices that use small inertial measurement units (IMUs) and linear actuators to guide users to perform construction tasks in real time: Drangle gives feedback for angling a drill relative to gravity, and Brangle assists with orienting bricks in the plane. We conducted a study with 18 participants to evaluate user performance and gather qualitative feedback. All users understood the edge-changing cues from both devices with minimal training. Drilling holes with Drangle was somewhat less accurate but much faster and easier than with a mechanical guide; 89% of participants preferred Drangle over the mechanical guide. Users generally understood Brangle’s feedback but found its hand-size-specific grip, palmar contact, and attractive tactile cues less intuitive than Drangle’s generalized form factor, fingertip contact, and repulsive cues. After summarizing design considerations, we propose application scenarios and speculate how such devices could improve construction workflows.},

abstract = {Commonsense question answering (CQA) generally means that the machine uses its mastered commonsense to answer questions without relevant background material, which is a challenging task in natural language processing. Existing methods focus on retrieving relevant subgraphs from knowledge graphs based on key entities and designing complex graph neural networks to perform reasoning over the subgraphs. However, they have the following problems: i) the nested entities in key entities lead to the introduction of irrelevant knowledge; ii) the QA context is not well integrated with the subgraphs; and iii) insufficient context knowledge hinders subgraph nodes understanding. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous-graph reasoning with context paraphrase method (HCP), which introduces the paraphrase knowledge from the dictionary into key entity recognition and subgraphs construction, and effectively fuses QA context and subgraphs during the encoding phase of the pre-trained language model (PTLM). Specifically, HCP filters the nested entities through the dictionary's vocabulary and constructs the Heterogeneous Path-Paraphrase (HPP) graph by connecting the paraphrase descriptions&lt;xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/xref&gt;&lt;fn id="fn1"&gt;&lt;label&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paraphrase descriptions are English explanations of words or phrases in WordNet and Wiktionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fn&gt; with the key entity nodes in the subgraphs. Then, by constructing the visible matrices in the PTLM encoding phase, we fuse the QA context representation into the HPP graph. Finally, to get the answer, we perform reasoning on the HPP graph by Mask Self-Attention. Experimental results on CommonsenseQA and OpenBookQA show that fusing QA context with HPP graph in the encoding stage and enhancing the HPP graph representation by using context paraphrase can improve the machine's commonsense reasoning ability.},

abstract = {Attention-based models are proliferating in the space of image analytics, including segmentation. The standard method of feeding images to transformer encoders is to divide the images into patches and then feed the patches to the model as a linear sequence of tokens. For high-resolution images, e.g. microscopic pathology images, the quadratic compute and memory cost prohibits the use of an attention-based model, if we are to use smaller patch sizes that are favorable in segmentation. The solution is to either use custom complex multi-resolution models or approximate attention schemes. We take inspiration from Adapative Mesh Refinement (AMR) methods in HPC by adaptively patching the images, as a pre-processing step, based on the image details to reduce the number of patches being fed to the model, by orders of magnitude. This method has a negligible overhead, and works seamlessly with any attention-based model, i.e. it is a pre-processing step that can be adopted by any attention-based model without friction. We demonstrate superior segmentation quality over SoTA segmentation models for real-world pathology datasets while gaining a geomean speedup of 6.9\texttimes{} for resolutions up to 64K2, on up to 2, 048 GPUs.},

abstract = {An important aspect of responsible recommendation systems is the transparency of the prediction mechanisms. This is a general challenge for deep-learning-based systems such as the currently predominant neural news recommender architectures, which are optimized to predict clicks by matching candidate news items against users’ reading histories. Such systems achieve state-of-the-art click-prediction performance, but the rationale for their decisions is difficult to assess. At the same time, the economic and societal impact of these systems makes such insights very much desirable.In this article, we ask the question to what extent the recommendations of current news recommender systems are actually based on content-related evidence from reading histories. We approach this question from an explainability perspective. Building on the concept of integrated gradients, we present a neural news recommender that can accurately attribute individual recommendations to news items and words in input reading histories while maintaining a top scoring click-prediction performance.Using our method as a diagnostic tool, we find that: (a), a substantial number of users’ clicks on news are not explainable from reading histories, and many history-explainable items are actually skipped; (b), while many recommendations are based on content-related evidence in histories, for others the model does not attend to reasonable evidence, and recommendations stem from a spurious bias in user representations.

abstract = {High accuracy nanopore basecalling uses large deep neural networks, requiring powerful GPUs, which is undesirable for sequencing experiments outside the lab. Research has shown that this can be circumvented by using smaller models to increase efficiency as well as basecalling speed. However, this comes at the cost of reduced accuracy, going against the trend of increasingly more complex models to extract the highest possible accuracy out of the source data. We propose learning structured sparsity during model training to find an improved trade-off between accuracy and model size, and thus basecalling speed. Our work introduces an improved pruning method with a delayed masking scheduler and removes redundant masks, saving compute, and is optimized for the basecaller training process. We find that the model size can be reduced by up to 21\texttimes{} with a reduction in match rate of 0.1% to 1.3% compared to Bonito-HAC, using a standardized benchmarking method. Our results indicate that the size of basecalling models can be reduced drastically without affecting accuracy, as long as researchers use appropriate training methods. Furthermore, our work helps democratize nanopore DNA sequencing, broadening the reach and impact of this technology.The code with the masking mechanism to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/meesfrensel/efficient-basecallers.},

Enabled by digital platforms, cities now have the opportunity to let citizens directly propose and vote on urban projects, using different voting input and aggregation rules. However, the choices cities make in terms of the rules of their PB have often not been informed by academic studies on voter behaviour and preferences. Therefore, this work presents the results of behavioural experiments where participants were asked to vote in a fictional PB setting. We identified approaches to designing PB voting that minimise cognitive load and enhance the perceived fairness and legitimacy of the digital process from the citizens’ perspective. In our study, participants preferred voting input formats that are more expressive (like rankings and distributing points) over simpler formats (like approval voting). Participants also indicated a desire for the budget to be fairly distributed across city districts and project categories. Participants found the Method of Equal Shares voting rule to be fairer than the conventional Greedy voting rule. These findings offer actionable insights for digital governance, contributing to the development of fairer and more transparent digital systems and collective decision-making processes for citizens.},

We, therefore, investigate how data science students start reflecting and what constitutes reflection-triggering contexts in data science education. For this, we introduce a reflective essay assignment and propose a reflection-sensitive inductive content analysis to analyze it. Our findings based on seven student reflective essays suggest that important reflection trigger characteristics in data science ethics education include students’ expectations, a new insight, motivators for reflection related to expectations, teaching formats, and emotions. Our reflection-sensitive analysis is suitable for explorative analysis and creates transparency about existing sensitizing concepts.},

abstract = {Codes for poly-size circuits: Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) considered codes for channels that are poly-size circuits which modify at most a p-fraction of the bits of the codeword. This class of channels is significantly stronger than Shannon’s binary symmetric channel (BSC), but weaker than Hamming’s channels which are computationally unbounded.   The goal of this direction is to construct explicit codes (namely, codes with poly-time encoding and decoding algorithms) with rate R(p)=1−H(p) (matching the capacity of the BSC, and beating the capacity of codes for Hamming’s channels). This goal implies circuit lower bounds, and specifically that E=DTIME(2O(n)) does not have poly-size circuits (and therefore explicit constructions need to be based on hardness assumptions).   We give the first explicit construction of such codes for poly-size channels. Specifically, for every 0 ≤ p &lt; 1/4, there are explicit codes with rate R(p)=1−H(p), assuming E does not have size 2Ω(n) nondeterministic circuits. This hardness assumption was introduced in the context of hardness vs. randomness tradeoffs, and is by now standard in complexity theory.   Our result builds on, and improves the previous work of Guruswami and Smith, and Shaltiel and Silbak (FOCS 2022). (These works gave a randomized Monte-Carlo construction, rather than explicit codes).    Functions that are hard to sample on low entropy distributions: A key component in our codes (that may be of independent interest) is a new complexity theoretic notion of hard to sample functions (HTS): We say that a function f on n bits is an HTS for circuits of size nc, if there exists a constant c′&gt;c, such that for every randomized circuit A of size nc that samples a distribution (X,Y) with (X) ≥ c′ · logn, it holds that Pr[Y=f(X)] ≤ 1/nc.   This is inspired by works by Viola on the complexity of distributions (SICOMP 2012, 2020), in which X is the uniform distribution. Here, we allow A to choose any distribution X (except for distributions X with very low min-entropy) and note that a circuit A of size nc, may be hardwired with ≈ nc outputs of f, and therefore, can easily produce pairs (X,f(X)) for a distribution X, with (X) ≈ c logn.   Building on classical works on “hardness amplification” (and using many additional tools and ideas from pseudorandomness) we show that if E does not have size 2Ω(n) nondeterministic circuits, then for every constant c, there is an HTS that is computable in time (nc).   Our codes are obtained by using our HTS (as well as additional tools and ideas) to achieve explicit constructions (under the hardness assumption) of several components in the code of Shaltiel and Silbak, replacing previously obtained randomized Monte-Carlo constructions of these components. We then need to revisit the codes of Shaltiel and Silbak, and significantly modify the construction and analysis, so that they work with the weaker components that we are able to explicitly construct.},

abstract = {The most common application of artificial immune networks (AINs) is on unsupervised learning tasks. This is due to the fact that AINs are inspired by the adaptive immune system, which consists of a network of antibodies that self-organises to form a memory of external antigens. The self-organising nature of AINs makes them a natural approach for solving problems involving learning and adapting to patterns or structures present in a dataset to form an abstract representation. Training AINs in this fashion means that the dataset need not have class labels because the typical aim of the learning process is not to perform classification. However, there have been attempts to use AINs for classification tasks by considering the resulting clusters of antibodies as representative of the classes present in a dataset. This has also been done when applying AINs to the task of recognising handwritten characters. However, in all the approaches found in the literature, the common method was to leave the task of discovering classes to the AINs. Doing so is contrary to how other models are trained to do classification tasks where data samples are provided along with their class labels to guide the learning process. Therefore, this paper presents a novel supervised learning approach to training AINs for multi-class classification. The proposed approach was tested on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and achieved a classification accuracy of 99.45%.},

abstract = {Computational marketing has become increasingly important in today's digital world, facing challenges such as massive heterogeneous data, multi-channel customer journeys, and limited marketing budgets. In this paper, we propose a general framework for marketing AI systems, the Neural Optimization with Adaptive Heuristics (NOAH) framework. NOAH is the first general framework for marketing optimization that considers both to-business (2B) and to-consumer (2C) products, as well as both owned and paid channels. We describe key modules of the NOAH framework, including prediction, optimization, and adaptive heuristics, providing examples for bidding and content optimization. We then detail the successful application of NOAH to LinkedIn's email marketing system, showcasing significant wins over the legacy ranking system. Additionally, we share details and insights that are broadly useful, particularly on: (i) addressing delayed feedback with lifetime value, (ii) performing large-scale linear programming with randomization, (iii) improving retrieval with audience expansion, (iv) reducing signal dilution in targeting tests, and (v) handling zero-inflated heavy-tail metrics in statistical testing.},

These novel approaches allow students to engage in rich, meaningful learning while building their broader STEM skillset. However, rates of adoption and curricular integration remain sporadic and difficult to understand. For many teachers, the question of integrating making and technology within their classroom becomes “is it worth the effort?” With few teachers expert in maker technologies before entering the classroom, issues of cognitive load associated with technology adoption are of high importance for teacher adoption of technology. How much mental effort it will take for them to learn a technology and subsequently teach it are essential parts of making informed instructional decisions within schools and classrooms. We use the term Technological Instructional Overhead (TIO) to evaluate and engage the various cognitive and practical considerations for teachers when potentially adopting maker projects and technologies within their classrooms.},

abstract = {Fog computing has attracted growing attention as a distributed computing platform for real-world problems, and semantic web technologies, including RDF (resource description framework), have been used as key enablers for semantic data processing. RDF reasoning allows us to perform high-level reasoning about real-world entities, but RDF reasoning in a distributed environment is still challenging because of the changing nature of the real world, leading to unbalanced loads among fog nodes and cloud servers. Existing distributed reasoning methods in fog computing cannot cope with such dynamism. This work proposes a dynamic load-balancing method for RDF reasoning in fog environments. Specifically, we devise a cost model of RDF reasoning considering the processing and network loads, thereby enabling balancing the load between fog nodes. We conduct a set of experiments to demonstrate the performance of the method.},

We explore two systems for capturing polynomial time: one system that disallows construction of iterable data, and one, based on the LFPL system of Martin Hofmann, that controls construction via a payment method. Both of these are extended to full dependent types via Quantitative Type Theory, allowing for arbitrary computation in types alongside guaranteed polynomial time computation in terms. We prove the soundness of the systems using a realisability technique due to Dal Lago and Hofmann. Our long-term goal is to combine the extensional reasoning of type theory with intensional reasoning about the resources intrinsically consumed by programs. This paper is a step along this path, which we hope will lead both to practical systems for reasoning about programs’ resource usage, and to theoretical use as a form of synthetic computational complexity theory.},

abstract = {The behavior of a rigid body primarily depends on its mass moments, which consist of the mass, center of mass, and moments of inertia. It is possible to manipulate these quantities without altering the geometric appearance of an object by introducing cavities in its interior. Algorithms that find cavities of suitable shapes and sizes have enabled the computational design of spinning tops, yo-yos, wheels, buoys, and statically balanced objects. Previous work is based, for example, on topology optimization on voxel grids, which introduces a large number of optimization variables and box constraints, or offset surface computation, which cannot guarantee that solutions to a feasible problem will always be found.In this work, we provide a mathematical analysis of constrained topology optimization problems that depend only on mass moments. This class of problems covers, among others, all applications mentioned above. Our main result is to show that no matter the outer shape of the rigid body to be optimized or the optimization objective and constraints considered, the optimal solution always features a quadric-shaped interface between material and cavities. This proves that optimal interfaces are always ellipsoids, hyperboloids, paraboloids, or one of a few degenerate cases, such as planes.This insight lets us replace a difficult topology optimization problem with a provably equivalent non-linear equation system in a small number (&lt;10) of variables, which represent the coefficients of the quadric. This system can be solved in a few seconds for most examples, provides insights into the geometric structure of many specific applications, and lets us describe their solution properties. Finally, our method integrates seamlessly into modern fabrication workflows because our solutions are analytical surfaces that are native to the CAD domain.},

abstract = {The Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) Sparks curriculum is an innovative computer science curriculum designed to introduce middle school and early high school students to the world of computer science through functional programming. Developed by the creators of BJC CS Principles (CSP), BJC Sparks presents a simplified yet engaging approach to programming, emphasizing the flow of information through functions. By focusing on functions rather than commands and iteration, BJC Sparks nurtures problem-solving skills and reduces bugs in future programming experiences.At SIGCSE 2023, the BJC Sparks team shared their insights into the curriculum's development and implementation, featuring real-world accounts from pioneering teachers. The use of microworlds and multimedia elements captured middle school students' interest, particularly in physical computing micro:bit activities. This approach showcased the potential of multimedia and data science projects in teaching functional programming through exciting, personalized activities.Building on the success of previous summer PD workshops with 76 educators across the U.S., we propose a condensed version of our comprehensive workshop for SIGCSE. Participants will gain a deep understanding of BJC Sparks' design principles, hands-on experience with the Snap! programming language, collaborative lab activities, alignment with CSTA standards, access to teacher materials and resources, and effective pedagogical strategies. Attendees will receive a three-hour professional development certificate and will be equipped to empower the next generation of young minds in the world of functional programming and beyond.},

Unlike existing methods that require specialized equipment to support the use of physical proxies, AniCraft only requires affordable markers, webcams, and daily accessible objects and materials. AniCraft allows creators to prototype character animations through three key stages: selection of virtual characters, fabrication of physical proxies, and manipulation of these proxies to animate the characters. This authoring workflow is underpinned by diverse physical proxies, manipulation types, and mapping strategies, which ease the process of posing virtual characters and mapping user interactions with physical proxies to animated movements of virtual characters. We provide a range of cases and potential applications to demonstrate how diverse physical proxies can inspire user creativity. User experiments show that our system can outperform traditional animation methods for rapid prototyping. Furthermore, we provide insights into the benefits and usage patterns of different materials, which lead to design implications for future research.},

abstract = {Single-cell sequencing technologies have been advancing rapidly, enabling scientists to identify cell subtypes in tissues and study their interrelationships at the single-cell level. Current algorithms can effectively differentiate cell subgroups when gene expression values of known markers vary greatly, yet they are inadequate for classifying cells based on functionality because functionality analysis cannot be achieved by examining a handful number of marker genes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel clustering method specifically designed to identify functional subtypes. This method employs mutual information to dissect interrelationships among gene expression patterns of functionally aggregated groups of genes, known as Biological Processes. We applied our clustering method to 12 publicly available Alzheimer's Disease (AD) related single-cell mRNA datasets and evaluated if our method can identify additional functional roles of various subtypes of cells such as resting microglia, transitional microglia, disease associated microglia type 1 and type 2---a key research topics in current AD studies. Our method not only confirms previously known functional relationships among these subtypes but also discovers new and more specific ones. This method offers a new way of subgrouping cells, and it can aid scientists in labeling cell subtypes with functional nomenclature.},

abstract = {There is a great need for high-quality and comprehensive data in the energy sector. This data is collected and preprocessed at considerable expense and is not only required for research, but also by planning offices and other industries in connection with planning activities, such as the creation of municipal heat planning. The NEED ecosystem will accelerate these processes establishing an efficient, robust, and scalable energy data ecosystem. Heterogeneous energy-related data sources will be brought together and automatically linked consistently across different sectors as well as temporal and spatial levels. In this context, existing data sources will not be replaced but rather integrated into the NEED ecosystem as dedicated sources including a semantic description on how to utilize them. In addition to conventional data sources from the various planning levels, we envision a quality assessment scheme based on the FAIR criteria. In reality, we are often faced with missing data, too. To close this gap we explore data-driven, model-driven, AI-based, and tool-driven generation of synthetic data. These heterogeneous data sources will be interlinked using ontology modules which will be represented in a knowledge graph. Via a semantic API, queries will be generated to identify the required data sources, which will be orchestrated to provide the data needed. This will enable researchers, planners, and others including their tools to interact with the NEED ecosystem, while a tool proxy will be able to translate the resulting data into proprietary formats, required by some tools to operate. The NEED ecosystem is planned to be a robust, easy-to-maintain, and flexible infrastructure to enhance planning energy measures at different spatial levels and with different time horizons. We envision to evaluate our NEED approach for the transparent provision of data by integrating relevant data sources as microservices, definition and analysis of application scenarios in the planning domain, as well as the integration of various tools for different planning purposes. With these elements, we will be able to quantify the efficiency of data procurement and demonstrate the functionality of the approach using practical use cases.},

abstract = {The adoption of ARM processor architectures is on the rise in the HPC ecosystem. Fugaku supercomputer is a homogeneous ARM-based machine, and is one among the most powerful machine in the world. In the programming world, dependent task-based programming models are gaining tractions due to their many advantages: dynamic load balancing, implicit expression of communication/computation overlap, early-bird communication posting,...MPI and OpenMP are two widespreads programming standards that make possible task-based programming at a distributed memory level. Despite its many advantages, mixed-use of the standard programming models using dependent tasks is still under-evaluated on large-scale machines. In this paper, we provide an overview on mixing OpenMP dependent tasking model with MPI with the state-of-the-art software stack (GCC-13, Clang17, MPC-OMP). We provide the level of performances to expect by porting applications to such mixed-use of the standard on the Fugaku supercomputers, using two benchmarks (Cholesky, HPCCG) and a proxy-application (LULESH). We show that software stack, resource binding and communication progression mechanisms are factors that have a significant impact on performance. On distributed applications, performances reaches up to 80% of effiency for task-based applications like HPCCG. We also point-out a few areas of improvements in OpenMP runtimes.},

However, while many advanced spatial analysis methods have been recently published, they are enmeshed with specific imaging technology. An opportunity exists to develop a technology-agnostic methodology that captures complex spatial patterns in the TME as phenotypes to use in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present a novel variation of spatial g-function and a comprehensive imaging-technologyagnostic framework that identifies rich spatial phenotypes that can be used in survival analysis and classification tasks. Applying our methodology to breast cancer, we uncover spatial phenotypes with significance to survival across racial groups and molecular subtypes of breast cancer. We find other phenotypes that are significant to the survival of specific patient categories (such as African American). We also demonstrate that our phenotypes reflect specific biological contexts. These results highlight the relevance of our proposed spatial analysis and phenotype discovery pipeline and demonstrate the benefits of the systematic exploration of spatial phenotypes for more personalized diagnosis and treatments.},

abstract = {CircRNA is closely related to human disease, so it is important to predict circRNA-disease association (CDA). However, the traditional biological detection methods have high difficulty and low accuracy, and computational methods represented by deep learning ignore the ability of the model to explicitly extract local depth information of the CDA. We propose a model based on knowledge graph from recursion and attention aggregation for circRNA-disease association prediction (KGRACDA). This model combines explicit structural features and implicit embedding information of graphs, optimizing graph embedding vectors. First, we built large-scale, multi-source heterogeneous datasets and construct a knowledge graph of multiple RNAs and diseases. After that, we use a recursive method to build multi-hop subgraphs and optimize graph attention mechanism by gating mechanism, mining local depth information. At the same time, the model uses multi-head attention mechanism to balance global and local depth features of graphs, and generate CDA prediction scores. KGRACDA surpasses other methods by capturing local and global depth information related to CDA. We update an interactive web platform HNRBase v2.0, which visualizes circRNA data, and allows users to download data and predict CDA using model.},

However, questions remain regarding the applicability of mean-field approximations: in particular, their approximation accuracy of real-world systems and conditions under which they become computationally tractable. We establish explicit finite-agent bounds for how well the MFG solution approximates the true N-player game for two popular mean-field solution concepts. Furthermore, for the first time, we establish explicit lower bounds indicating that MFGs are poor or uninformative at approximating N-player games assuming only Lipschitz dynamics and rewards. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of solving MFGs with only Lipschitz properties and prove that they are in the class of PPAD -complete problems conjectured to be intractable, similar to general sum N player games. Our theoretical results underscore the limitations of MFGs and complement and justify existing work by proving difficulty in the absence of common theoretical assumptions.},

abstract = {There is a rising interest in animating realistic virtual agents for multiple purposes in different domains. Such a task requires systems capable of generating complex mental states on par with human emotional complexity. Considering the high representational capacity of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), it is only natural to consider them in such applications. In this work, we propose a conditional GAN model for generating sequences of facial expressions of categorical complex emotions. Trained on a scarce and highly imbalanced dataset, the proposed model is able to generate realistic variable-length sequences in a single inference step. These expressions of emotional states, of which there are 24 in total, follow the Facial Actions Coding System (FACS) formatting. In the absence of meaningful objective evaluation methods, we propose a deep-learning-based metric to assess the realism of generated Action Unit (AU) sequences: the Action Unit Fr\'{e}chet Inception Distance (AUFID). Objective and subjective results validate the realism of our generated samples.},

abstract = {Photonic quantum computing has recently emerged as a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing by photonic qubits. These protocols make use of nondeterministic gates, enabling universal quantum computation. However, the suggested solutions heavily use particle number resolving detectors (PNRDs), which are experimentally hard to realize and are usually biased in practice. We investigate the possibility of suppressing such errors caused by such photodetector imperfections by adjusting the optimal beamsplitter and phaseshifter angles in the interferometer corresponding to nondeterministic gates. Moreover, we devise an optimization method for determining the adjusted angles, which may achieve higher output state fidelities while controlling the success probabilities of the nondeterministic gates.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is the most established technique to measure transcript abundance. HTS reads often contain uncertain or low-quality base calls that introduce ambiguity in determining the underlying sequence. In many applications, these unresolved nucleotides are handled by looking at the consensus sequence of all HTS reads. However, this approach is not applicable where sequence heterogeneity is of biological relevance. To gauge the biological complexity of a set of HTS reads in face of unresolved base calls, one may apply the parsimony principle, i.e., find a smallest set of sequences that cover all ambiguous reads. But, no method to date solves this problem optimally. Here, we present FiSSC, a new method to find a smallest sequence cover of a set of ambiguous reads. We first prove that the problem is NP-hard. We then present filtering steps that preserve optimal solution size, and an integer-linear-programming formulation, which together form FiSSC. We tested FiSSC on A-to-I RNA editing datasets with binary ambiguities. FiSSC outperformed all baseline methods and achieved optimal results in all but one dataset. We expect FiSSC to advance the study of sequence variation and biological complexity of ambiguous reads in various biological domains.},

This is a planning problem, but these games often have large state spaces. In this paper, we show that Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) can directly manipulate very large game state spaces, and this power can be leveraged to construct instantly responsive player assistance systems. We use BDDs to build a compressed representation of a game’s state-transition function, and use it to derive an action policy that makes shortest-path recommendations for any feasible state towards any achievable goal in milliseconds. We introduce the intuition behind planning with BDDs using a tiny grid world, and eventually scale to an integrated system for start-to-finish gameplay assistance in Super Metroid.},

Currently, many methods focus on predicting inter-chain contacts, but achieving precise predictions remains challenging. Here, we have developed a prediction model, AttCON-Homo, which focuses on predicting both contact and distance maps of homo-oligomeric protein complexes. The input features of AttCON-Homo integrate attention maps generated by two protein language models (PLMs), ESM-MSA and ESM2. These features are processed using random erasing. Additionally, AttCON-Homo incorporates various attention mechanisms within its residual network, effectively capturing long-range sequence interactions. Tested on multiple datasets, AttCON-Homo outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including DeepInter, DeepHomo2.0, and CDPred, in key prediction metrics such as top1, top10, top50, topL/10, and topL/5 inter-chain contacts precision (L: Length of the monomer in homodimer).

Recent efforts on fine-tuning focus on reducing training data and lightening computation overload but neglect alignment with user intentions, particularly in manual curation of multi-modal training data and intent-oriented evaluation. Informed by a formative study with fine-tuning practitioners for comprehending user intentions, we propose IntentTuner, an interactive framework that intelligently incorporates human intentions throughout each phase of the fine-tuning workflow. IntentTuner enables users to articulate training intentions with imagery exemplars and textual descriptions, automatically converting them into effective data augmentation strategies. Furthermore, IntentTuner introduces novel metrics to measure user intent alignment, allowing intent-aware monitoring and evaluation of model training. Application exemplars and user studies demonstrate that IntentTuner streamlines fine-tuning, reducing cognitive effort and yielding superior models compared to the common baseline tool.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a distributed pseudo-likelihood method (DPL) to conveniently identify the community structure of large-scale networks. Specifically, we first propose a block-wise splitting method to divide large-scale network data into several subnetworks and distribute them among multiple workers. For simplicity, we assume the classical stochastic block model. Then, the DPL algorithm is iteratively implemented for the distributed optimization of the sum of the local pseudo-likelihood functions. At each iteration, the worker updates its local community labels and communicates with the master. The master then broadcasts the combined estimator to each worker for the new iterative steps. Based on the distributed system, DPL significantly reduces the computational complexity of the traditional pseudo-likelihood method using a single machine. Furthermore, to ensure statistical accuracy, we theoretically discuss the requirements of the worker sample size. Moreover, we extend the DPL method to estimate degree-corrected stochastic block models. The superior performance of the proposed distributed algorithm is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies and real data analysis.},

We conducted four focus groups and eight semi-structured interviews with 26 UX practitioners to investigate how AIGC tools influence social dynamics in UX collaboration. Our findings indicated that AIGC tools not only mitigated conflicts but also introduced potential new conflicts. AIGC tools expanded the roles of UX practitioners and fostered a team culture characterized by exploring and discussing. Participants have higher expectations for AI-assisted design in user understanding and prototype evaluation, and team-motivated AI tools learning. Based on these findings, we discussed the benefits and concerns of conflict resolution through AIGC and the importance of teams in AI learning.

abstract = {Decoding brain activity through electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is still challenging, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution of EEG signals. To address these limitations, we propose an advanced end-to-end network, called the parallel multi-scale attention network (PMSA-Net). This novel architecture introduces the parallel structure and channel attention mechanism to enhance the accuracy and robustness of EEG signal classification. Specifically, PMSA-Net initially expands EEG signals into the depth dimension to improve spatial resolution, thereby better capturing and learning spatial information. Subsequently, the multi-scale technique is applied to enhance the feature extraction capability of the model. Finally, channel attention mechanisms are embedded in the parallel structure to recalibrate features across multiple dimensions. Experimental results based on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset demonstrate that the model shows superior performance to other benchmark methods, achieving the highest average accuracy and kappa across all datasets. Moreover, a series of ablation experiments are conducted to further confirm the effectiveness of the structural improvements.},

abstract = {Systolic arrays are a promising approach to achieving high-performance processing based on highly parallelized designs in various fields, such as AI and bioinformatics. Many previous studies have devoted considerable effort to exploring efficient circuit designs for specific processing. However, the increasing size of systolic arrays forces us to process increasingly large workloads by dividing them into smaller pieces. Therefore, we propose a systolic array platform based on a two-dimensional FPGA plane in which multiple FPGAs are connected by a virtual network. The systolic array realized by this system can be freely customized in shape and size according to the target. Distributed memory access through off-chip memory on each FPGA board and simple stream processing enable scalable performance. This paper presents a preliminary implementation based on the proposed systolic array platform and its performance evaluation. The evaluation results show that the proposed method improves the processing performance in proportion to the number of FPGAs. The results also show that the proposed platform is highly scalable due to the small circuit area required, and that the processing performance depends on the network bandwidth, which means that recent high-bandwidth FPGA boards can be expected to significantly improve the performance.},

These rewirings happen at different rates for different cells, and the rates can change over time, yet we can only observe the cell at a limited number of stages of their evolution. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining evolutionary trajectories of dynamic biological networks. We develop a novel algorithm DANTE (Determining Adaptation trajectories in biological Networks Through Evolutionary mapping), which maps multiple cellular network evolution patterns in accordance with the greatest possible similarity. We evaluate our method on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using a mouse model with evolutionary patterns caused by chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and compare it to four alternative strategies. Our experimental results demonstrate that DANTE outperforms competing methods in terms of trajectory similarity, and the advantages of DANTE over competing methods grow when network trajectories are incomplete.},

abstract = {Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging has the ability to recover 3D images of scenes outside the direct line of sight, which is of growing interest for diverse applications. Despite the remarkable progress, NLOS imaging of dynamic objects is still challenging. It requires a large amount of multibounce photons for the reconstruction of single-frame data. To overcome this obstacle, we develop a computational framework for dynamic time-of-flight NLOS imaging based on plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms. By combining imaging forward model with the deep denoising network from the computer vision community, we show a 4 frames-per-second (fps) 3D NLOS video recovery (128 \texttimes{} 128 \texttimes{} 512) in post-processing. Our method leverages the temporal similarity among adjacent frames and incorporates sparse priors and frequency filtering. This enables higher-quality reconstructions for complex scenes. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithm both through simulations and real data.},

abstract = {The concept of dealing damage is established and widespread in video games. With growing complexity and countless interactions in modern games, capturing how damage unfolds becomes an intricate problem - for developers just as for players. Misunderstanding how to optimize damage potentials includes risks of game imbalances, game-breaking exploits, mismatches between player skill and challenge (harming flow), and impaired perceived competence. All of these considerably impact player experience, game reception, success, and retention, yet polishing optimal strategies remains often a player community effort. To accelerate, inform and ease this process, we implemented an interactive tool capable of simulating, visualizing, planning and comparing damage strategies in video games. Following a case study within the Guild Wars 2 community, we contribute a player-driven perspective on the problem of damage optimization, as well as an artifact that resulted in empirical improvements – advancing the fields of game analytics, game evaluation methods and self-regulated learning.},

abstract = {Pseudouridine is a type of abundant RNA modification that is seen in many different animals and is crucial for a variety of biological functions. Accurately identifying pseudouridine sites within the RNA sequence is vital for the subsequent study of various biological mechanisms of pseudouridine. However, the use of traditional experimental methods faces certain challenges. The development of fast and convenient computational methods is necessary to accurately identify pseudouridine sites from RNA sequence information. To address this, we introduce a novel pseudouridine site prediction model called PseU-KeMRF, which can identify pseudouridine sites in three species, H. sapiens, S. cerevisiae, and M. musculus. Through comprehensive analysis, we selected four RNA coding schemes, including binary feature, position-specific trinucleotide propensity based on single strand (PSTNPss), nucleotide chemical property (NCP) and pseudo k-tuple composition (PseKNC). Then the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) method was used for feature selection and the feature subset was optimized. Finally, the best feature subsets are input into the kernel based on multinomial random forests (KeMRF) classifier for cross-validation and independent testing. As a new classification method, compared with the traditional random forest, KeMRF not only improves the node splitting process of decision tree construction based on multinomial distribution, but also combines the easy to interpret kernel method for prediction, which makes the classification performance better. Our results indicate superior predictive performance of PseU-KeMRF over other existing models, which can prove that PseU-KeMRF is a highly competitive predictive model that can successfully identify pseudouridine sites in RNA sequences.},

Existing methods do not correct batch effects satisfactorily, especially with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. To address this challenge, we introduce fast-scBatch, a novel and efficient two-phase algorithm for batch-effect correction in scRNA-seq data, designed to handle non-linear and complex batch effects. Specifically, this method utilizes the inherent correlation structure of the data for batch effect correction and employs a neural network to expedite the process. It outputs a corrected expression matrix, facilitating downstream analyses. We validated fast-scBatch through simulation studies and on two scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in batch-effect correction compared to current methods, as evidenced by visualization using UMAP plots, and metrics including Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI).},

The absence of a nationwide DS curriculum in the US prompts educators to independently devise engaging DS curriculum. With support from the National Science Foundation and the United States Amateur Radio on the International Space Station, UC Berkeley teaching faculty developed a pilot curriculum, Student Mission Control (SMC), to engage middle and high school students with direct access to data and experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to help develop skills of data inquiry, analysis, and exploration.SMC addresses a crucial challenge in computing education-enhancing the depth and engagement of data analysis activities with students. By using ISS on-orbit sensor data, SMC offers activities focused on data literacy, catering to an evolving need in computing courses. SMC not only enriches educational experiences, but also broadens participation in computing from underrepresented students to engage with authentic STEM-based data and visualizations, leveraging their interest in science, engineering, and space exploration.To extend the reach of SMC, we propose a workshop at SIGCSE. This workshop will equip participants with insights into the ISS, telemetry data, SMC design principles, and curriculum highlights. Engaging participants in collaborative hands-on notebook-based lab activities, the workshop will empower educators to integrate space-themed content into their classrooms. Attendees will receive a three-hour PD certificate, supporting their efforts to innovate CS education and make it more appealing to diverse students.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the explanatory model approach to address challenges in computing education arising from rapid technological developments and paradigm shifts, particularly regarding artificial intelligence and machine learning. Traditional approaches in computing education aim to teach basic concepts derived from the computer science discipline as they are in order to support students’ understanding of these concepts and digital technologies that implement these concepts. This approach is challenged in topics like machine learning, where the ground truth of the inner workings and the behaviors of these technologies is not so clear, making rethinking approaches in computing education necessary. The explanatory model approach suggests that students learn models about computational concepts and digital artifacts that help them understand, explain, and reason about digital technologies. While drawing on the notion of models in science and science education, this approach emphasizes learning and using explanatory models as a focal point in computing classes. Doing so may help students make use of these models as tools and enable them to reflect on and critique different models in various contexts. Additionally, this paper discusses how making explanatory models explicit in research can enrich computing education research and our discourses and describes avenues for researching explanatory models as different perspectives on computational concepts.},

abstract = {As a series of single-stranded RNAs, circRNAs have been implicated in numerous diseases and can serve as valuable biomarkers for disease therapy and prevention. However, traditional biological experiments demand significant time and effort. Therefore, various computational methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but how to extract features more comprehensively remains a challenge that needs further attention in the future. In this study, we propose a unique approach to predict circRNA-disease associations based on resistance distance and graph attention network (RDGAN). First, the associations of circRNA and disease are obtained by fusing multiple databases, and resistance distance as a similarity matrix is used to further deal with the sparse of the similarity matrices. Then the circRNA-disease heterogeneous network is constructed based on the similiarity of circRNA-circRNA, disease-disease and the known circRNA-disease adjacency matric. Second, leveraging the three neural network modules-ResGatedGraphConv, GAT and MFConv-we gather node feature embeddings collected from the heterogeneous network. Subsequently, all the characteristics are supplied to the self-attention mechanism to predict new potential connections. Finally, our model obtains a remarkable AUC value of 0.9630 through five-fold cross-validation, surpassing the predictive performance of the other eight state-of-the-art models.},

The fairly recent, state-of-the-art transformer-based language model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT has given NLP research for low-resource languages such as Filipino/Tagalog the opportunity to advance, but is held back for many by its high hardware requirements. Therefore, the researchers wish to contribute to the accessibility of Filipino natural language processing research by determining if quantization would be beneficial for low-resource BERT models such as for Tagalog.},

These variants forbid the nesting of generalization variables, restrict the structure of their arguments, and are unitary.

abstract = {Long-read DNA sequencing is becoming increasingly popular for genetic diagnostics. Minimap2 is the state-of-the-art long-read aligner. However, Minimap2's chaining step is slow on the CPU and takes 40-68% of the time especially for long DNA reads. Prior works in accelerating Minimap2 either lose mapping accuracy, are closed source (and not updated) or deliver inconsistent speedups for longer reads. We introduce mm2-gb which accelerates the chaining step of Minimap2 on GPU without compromising mapping accuracy. In addition to intra- and inter-read parallelism exploited by prior works, mm2-gb exploits finer levels of parallelism by breaking down high latency large workloads into smaller independent segments that can be run in parallel and leverages several strategies for better workload balancing including split-kernels and prioritized scheduling of segments based on sorted size. We show that mm2-gb on an AMD Instinct™ MI210 GPU achieves 2.57-5.33x performance improvement on long nanopore reads (10kb-100kb), and up to 1.87x performance gain on super long reads (100kb-300kb) compared to SIMD accelerated mm2-fast. mm2-gb is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/Minimap2onGPU/mm2-gb.},

Given a large signaling network for a cancer type, known targets from approved anticancer drugs, a set of cancer mutated genes, and a combination size parameter k, panacea automatically generates a delta histogram that depicts the distribution of k-sized target combinations based on their topological influence on cancer mutated genes and other nodes. To this end, we formally define the novel problem of influence-driven target combination profiling (i-TCP) and propose an algorithm that employs two innovative personalized PageRank-based measures, PEN distance and PEN-diff, to quantify this influence and generate the delta histogram. Our experimental studies on signaling networks related to four cancer types demonstrate that our proposed measures outperform several popular network properties in profiling known target combinations. Notably, we demonstrate that panacea can significantly reduce the candidate k-node combination exploration space, addressing a longstanding challenge for tasks such as in silico target combination prediction in large signaling networks.},

We then extend this to show a similar impossibility result for single transferable vote (elimination voting). These negative results are information-theoretic and agnostic to the number of queries. Finally, for scoring rules that are computable with limited-sized queries, we give parameterized upper and lower bounds on the number of such queries a deterministic or randomized algorithm must make to determine the score-maximizing candidate. While there is no gap between our bounds for deterministic algorithms, identifying the exact query complexity for randomized algorithms is a challenging open problem, of which we solve one special case.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have captured significant interest from both academia and industry due to their impressive performance across various textual tasks. However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through instruction tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 ± 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 ± 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.},

abstract = {Abstraction emerges as a valuable method across diverse domains of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in the field of knowledge representation and reasoning. Intuitively, abstraction maps a complicated structure to a simpler version of it. That reduces the computational complexity of the task being considered, as it provides us with the ability to focus on the parts of the problem that are relevant to the solution. In our view, such a tool can also have potential in the field of non-monotonic reasoning. Non-monotonicity is a crucial notion as it is very common when reasoning over defeasible knowledge. Adding new entries to our current knowledge, oftentimes results in restricting the conclusions that we can draw. For this form of reasoning we use certain formalisms, such as computational argumentation and Logic Programming (LP), that help us capture non-monotonicity. However, interpreting these formalisms faces hardships due to the large structures that might occur when representing the problem in question. Hence, coming up with ways to manage these structures easier is necessary. Recently, abstraction was shown to be a promising tool when dealing with Argumentation Frameworks (AFs) as well as with LP. AFs are frameworks with graph-like structure, whose nodes represent arguments with no internal structure, while edges stand for conflicts among the arguments. In our research we focus on continuing in this direction by employing structured frameworks such as Assumption-Based Argumentation Frameworks (ABAFs). Subsequently, we will extend our research to similar formalisms such as LP.},

abstract = {Identification of an optimal protospacer at a disease-associated gene is critically important for the design of a high-efficiency base editor that does not have much bystander effect to edit this gene. Current machine learning methods are prone to overestimating the editing efficiencies of those low-efficiency editors, leading to wrong recommendations of high-efficiency protospacers; meanwhile they made separate predictions for editing efficiency and outcome proportion using two independent models, giving rise to performance inconsistency and confusing the identification of optimal protospacers. We propose an ensemble of paired convolutional neural networks for accurate prediction of outcome proportions and then we derive editing efficiencies directly from the proportions. Our method is able to significantly reduce the performance inconsistency between editing efficiency and editing proportion predictions caused by the two-model approach. Our method generalizes well to work on a range of different editing platforms. Furthermore, our method recommends optimal protospacers by ranking the candidates' picking score which we newly defined as a harmonic indexing score integrating both of on-target editing efficiency and bystander editing effect.},

Our user study shows that Neural Canvas is an effective creativity support tool, enabling users to rapidly explore visual ideas and iterate 3D scenic designs.

This has led to the emergence of numerous machine learning and deep learning models that have been proposed and applied to tackle this complex task. While existing models typically adopt an extraction-based approach, which requires breaking down the extraction of biomedical events into multiple subtasks for sequential processing, making it prone to cascading errors. This paper presents a novel approach by constructing a biomedical event generation model based on the framework of the pre-trained language model &lt;italic&gt;T5&lt;/italic&gt;. We employ a sequence-to-sequence generation paradigm to obtain events, the model utilizes constrained decoding algorithm to guide sequence generation, and a curriculum learning algorithm for efficient model learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate it on two public benchmark datasets, Genia 2011 and Genia 2013. Our model achieves superior performance, illustrating the effectiveness of generative modeling of biomedical events.},

abstract = {Protein-metal ion interactions play a central role in the onset of numerous diseases. When amino acid changes lead to missense mutations in metal-binding sites, the disrupted interaction with metal ions can compromise protein function, potentially causing severe human ailments. Identifying these disease-associated mutation sites within metal-binding regions is paramount for understanding protein function and fostering innovative drug development. While some computational methods aim to tackle this challenge, they often fall short in accuracy, commonly due to manual feature extraction and the absence of structural data. We introduce MetalPrognosis, an innovative, alignment-free solution that predicts disease-associated mutations within metal-binding sites of metalloproteins with heightened precision. Rather than relying on manual feature extraction, MetalPrognosis employs sliding window sequences as input, extracting deep semantic insights from pre-trained protein language models. These insights are then incorporated into a convolutional neural network, facilitating the derivation of intricate features. Comparative evaluations show MetalPrognosis outperforms leading methodologies like MCCNN and M-Ionic across various metalloprotein test sets. Furthermore, an ablation study reiterates the effectiveness of our model architecture.},

We show how it is possible to apply principled software engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven legal reasoning of complex statutes and to unlock new applications in automated meta-reasoning such as mutation-guided example generation and metamorphic property-based testing.},

LLMs have been shown to excel at producing correct code to CS1 and CS2 problems, and can even act as friendly assistants to students learning how to code. Recent work shows that LLMs demonstrate unequivocally superior results in being able to explain and resolve compiler error messages—for decades, one of the most frustrating parts of learning how to code. However, LLM-generated error message explanations have only been assessed by expert programmers in artificial conditions. This work sought to understand how novice programmers resolve programming error messages (PEMs) in a more realistic scenario. We ran a within-subjects study with n = 106 participants in which students were tasked to fix six buggy C programs. For each program, participants were randomly assigned to fix the problem using either a stock compiler error message, an expert-handwritten error message, or an error message explanation generated by GPT-4. Despite promising evidence on synthetic benchmarks, we found that GPT-4 generated error messages outperformed conventional compiler error messages in only 1 of the 6 tasks, measured by students’ time-to-fix each problem. Handwritten explanations still outperform LLM and conventional error messages, both on objective and subjective measures.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) regulation is required for the vast majority of biological processes in living organisms. Some diseases may be caused by improper transcriptional regulation. Identifying the target genes of TFs is thus critical for understanding cellular processes and analyzing disease molecular mechanisms. Computational approaches can be challenging to employ when attempting to predict potential interactions between TFs and target genes. In this paper, we present a novel graph model (PPRTGI) for detecting TF-target gene interactions using DNA sequence features. Feature representations of TFs and target genes are extracted from sequence embeddings and biological associations. Then, by combining the aggregated node feature with graph structure, PPRTGI uses a graph neural network with personalized PageRank to learn interaction patterns. Finally, a bilinear decoder is applied to predict interaction scores between TF and target gene nodes. We designed experiments on six datasets from different species. The experimental results show that PPRTGI is effective in regulatory interaction inference, with our proposed model achieving an area under receiver operating characteristic score of 93.87% and an area under precision-recall curves score of 88.79% on the human dataset. This paper proposes a new method for predicting TF-target gene interactions, which provides new insights into modeling molecular networks and can thus be used to gain a better understanding of complex biological systems.},

The role of gene body (GB) methylation in cancer remains rather unclear. Particularly, integrating methylation data with gene expression, in order to improve the classification of disease subtypes, remains under-explored. In this study, we use SCClust (Sparse Canonical Correlation analysis with Clustering), a method that combines high-dimensional omics data using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), to gene expression and DNA methylation data for two cancer genomics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to distinguish between underlying subtypes. We evaluate the identified subtypes using Kaplan-Meier plots and hazard ratio analysis on colon cancer and kidney cancer data. Our findings demonstrate that integrating both types of DNA methylation data with gene expression results in similar subtypes and outperforms existing methods. The underlying information revealed as a result of data integration is different depending on what type of methylation data is integrated with gene expression. The significance of this study lies in the advancements in understanding the epigenetics of cancer as well as categorization of cancer data that incorporates epigenome with transcriptome.},

We found that in HPCC benchmark tests, the per-core performance of Grace is similar to or faster than AMD Milan cores, and the high core count often allows NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip to have per-node performance similar to Intel Sapphire Rapids with High Bandwidth Memory: slower in matrix multiplication (by 17%) and FFT (by 6%), faster in Linpack (by 9%)).

abstract = {Currently, the research prospect of deep learning applied to data prefetching in multi-core architectures are very broad.  In order to give full play to the performance of parallel computing in multi-core processor systems, based on an in-depth discussion of the research of multi-core cache prefetching neural network model based on deep learning, a new deep learning model is constructed by introducing Convolutional Neural Network (Text CNN) and CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention layer and utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) parallel computing. The model is able to operate efficiently in multi-core architectures and effectively predict data access patterns to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data prefetching, thus optimizing the performance of the overall system. In order to evaluate the performance improvement of the improved model in cache prefetching in a multi-core processor system, multiple sets of experiments were conducted for comparative analysis. Experimental results compared with Voyager, the improved model improves the prefetching page and offset accuracies by 5.5% and 5.3%, respectively, and the overall accuracy is improved by 5.8%, the loss rate is reduced by 1.5%, the coverage rate is improved by 8.4%, and the F1 score value is improved by 0.07, which indicates that the improved model achieves a significant enhancement in cache prefetching effectiveness.},

abstract = {Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) or the units they are likely to visit during the course of the stay can be a vital source of information for healthcare administrators towards effective resource planning. However, predicting these parameters can be challenging due to the lack of sufficient information at admission time, and its potential dependence on inherent practices within the hospital. Prior efforts have focused predominantly on predicting LOS, statically at admission and in isolation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-task learning approach to predict a patient's next unit and the expected length (in days) of the remaining stay. Our approach is capable of capturing any latent relationship that may exist between these two variables. Experimental results on a large real-world in-patient database show that our multi-task model outperforms its single-task counterpart and other classical machine learning models. Our study also demonstrates that: a) it is possible to achieve high prediction scores (e.g., mean absolute error of 2.0 days for remaining LOS, and over 80% accuracy for next unit); and b) such high prediction accuracy can be realized early on---in most cases within the first two days of a patient's stay.},

abstract = {One of the most important strategies for sustainable manufacturing systems is sustainable scheduling. It involves allocating a set of production jobs within a manufacturing environment while ensuring the fulfilment of the objectives on the environmental, social, and economic dimensions. However, achieving these objectives is complex, as it often needs balancing competing priorities among the three dimensions. In this paper, a three-objectives non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) coupled with an event-based simulation is proposed for a hybrid flowshop problem, to reach a sustainable scheduling. This simulation-optimization approach, which encompasses the Triple-Bottom Line (TBL) objectives, aims to minimize total energy consumption as the environmental dimension, minimize a labor indicator as the social dimension, and minimize the Mean Completion Time (MCT) as the economic dimension, simultaneously. NSGA-II, as a meta-heuristic, is utilized for exploring and exploiting potential solutions within the feasible region, while the event-based simulation is used for evaluating the solutions and the fitness functions of the three dimensions. Consequently, this coupling approach promptly and efficiently explores the set of non-dominated solutions, or Pareto front, to analyze the real trade-off between the TBL. Additionally, validation experiments were carried out in a defined and simulated hybrid flowshop environment, featuring dynamic arrivals, to examine two cases: one consisting of homogeneously skilled workers (Case A) and another comprising heterogeneously skilled workers (Case B). Furthermore, a comparison among the three single-objective algorithms (one for each TBL target) is provided. The preliminary results suggest that the proposed approach achieves reasonable solutions for the hybrid flowshop problem and can be a consistent method for decision-making in sustainable manufacturing.},
